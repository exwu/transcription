The weather grew rapidly cold as they travelled northward, a combination of the changing seasons and rising elevation. They made frequent stops to wait out torrents of rain and dangerous mountain roads, sitting side by side in silence as rain drummed loudly on the windows of their van.

Now that their sense of urgency had passed (Erika reassured Sebastian that she would let him know if she sensed anyone with any intention to pursue them) Erika stuck mostly to small mountain roads, distant from any sort of civilization. When S. drove, the small towns they passed they stoppedto buy supplies before moving on. Erika would drive past without any mind. 

It was late afternoon when Sebastian awoke suddenly. The car was stopped, Erika was no where to be seen. They were at some small town. A few rows of houses, a general store, not much else.
