move to the interrogation room," said 
Dr. Alto. "Where did she go?" he 
said forcefully. 

"She didn't tell me!" Sebastian 
said. He grabbed 
his knees to keep his hands from 
shaking. "She didn't tell me anything. 
She only wanted to say goodbye."

"Even if she didn't tell you, you 
know, don't you?"

Sebastian said nothing. (( They could 
compell him to speak. They could torture 
him, drug him, but nothing more than 
what his body was doing to himself.))

"Time is past for these petty 
loyalties, Sebastian," said Dr. Alto. 
"The whole of humanity is at stake. Who 
is her parent? Where is she going?"

"She didn't even bother taking 
you with her when she escaped," said 
Jared, though he seemed to regret 
it as soon as he had. 

"You can't run from these things 
forever," said Dr. Alto.
