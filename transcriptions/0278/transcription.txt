Sasha quickly looked away, hiding the mark 
on his face.

"Master Freeman would like you to attend this 
morning's meeting of the [[inner circle]]" 
Sasha said quietly. 

"Will you be there as well?" Sebastian 
asked. 

Sasha nodded. 

Sebastian followed Sasha out 
from the cell. As they walked through Sebastian 
couldn't help but look through the rows of 
closed doors, thinking of what was behind 
them. More prisoners, like himself? More 
items of Freeman's collection, like himself? It was 
strange to think of himself as separate 
from them now, on the wrong side of 
the doors. 

"I'm sorry," Sasha said, quietly. "About 
everything. I always try to 
do what's right, but---"

"Don't worry about it," said Sebastian,
looking down the hall. "I've done worse to 
myself, haven't I?"

Sasha didn't reply. They walked 
down the hall in silence. It was odd, the 
first time he'd been out of his cell, not flanked by 
guards.
