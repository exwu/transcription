"I don't understand," he said. 

"What? What's wrong?" Erika asked. 

"Erika, what do you see?"

Erika stepped closer to the pedestal, 
examining the statuette. 

"It's a statue," she said. 
"Hard to say what of. Maybe a 
crocodile? Or a lion. But it's got 
a woman's breasts."

Sebastian inhaled sharply. 
To each viewer the statuette 
would appear differently. To the innocent, 
Maat, adorned in feathers. To the 
guilty, Ammit, the maneater, 
hungry of heart.

After all this, and still he saw Maat. 
Sebastian looked at the carnage 
it had fought [[??]] the men who had 
fought to bring him here, only 
to die bloodily at their goal. And 
beyond, the Foundation's 
soldiers as well [[ or maybe the Foundation triggers the flood when whatever kills Simons escapes? ]] some trying to 
call their mothers, recovering 
addicts, guilty lovers.
