it. 

"I didn't really feel like telling 
you about all of this," said Sebastian, 
leaning his forehead against the glass. "But 
here I am, making bad decisions again."

[[ I can hardly blame you for a night of bad decisions when I've been making them my whole life. / How do you deal with it? / Realize that nobody really manages to do any better. ]]

"Why not? You thought I'd think less of you?"

"More or less. You seem to be under the 
impression that I'm a good person. [[ I get the feeling you look up to me. ]] But 
just like everybody else, I do 
the same stupid shit to myself 
and complain about it like it wasn't my fault."

"There's no such thing as a good person," 
Erika said. 
"If there were 
that would mean there are evil people 
as well. I'd probably be one of them. But 
listening to people's feelings and thoughts, 
you learn that there's 
no such thing as good or evil. We all just 
make stupid decisions out of 
fear, or selfishness, or guilt, or hormones. 
To be honest, that pretty much sums 
up the whole of the human 
condition."
