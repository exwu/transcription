had grabbed at the only patch of bare 
skin exposed at her neck. Her face went 
horribly blank. Her arm drifted slowly 
downward. 

Sebastian dropped the gun. Freeman 
steadied himself, careful never to let 
go of her neck. 

"Such a stupid girl," he said. 
"She seems to have 
forgotten how easily she can be controlled."

Sebastian forced himself to tear his 
eyes away from Erika's lifeless 
expression. From the scales came a 
sound like the hiss of sands or the 
spit of a snake. There was an unfurling 
that extended past the 
bounds of the feather, a presence blossoming 
into wakefulness. 

(( he expected the scales to be bigger)) 

"Sasha," he said. The youth, 
was standing beside him. 
He turned to Sebastian, face frozen 
into an expression of shock. 

"Sasha, take her hand," 
he whispered. "you can save her. 
Please, you [[Sasha has no reason to want to save Erika. I guess he could lie and say that it'd stop her from killing Freeman. which is true. Because sebastian kills freeman. Because he's just as cruel as Erika. -sigh -]]
