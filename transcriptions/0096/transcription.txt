"No, never mind," said Sebastian. 

Michelle raised an eyebrow. "I missed 
you yesterday. Where were you?" 

"Health related," said Sebastian, 
mostly telling the truth. 

Nerves kept Sebastian on edge through 
the morning. He asked Michelle about 
her research to try to distract himself, 
but found his focus continually 
pulled away to the dreams, to his 
wounds, to Erika's warning. His worries 
sat like a pit in his stomach. Again, 
he knew what 
was coming, again there was nothing 
he could do about it. 

After going through the motions of prayer 
and meditation, at last they brought 
them to the compound's main building. 
Sebastian recognized the way 
to the main hall. 

The room was empty. Their footsteps 
floated up to the beams with motes 
of dust from the scant sunlight let in 
by small windows.
