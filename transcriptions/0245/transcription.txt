"At about 10 or so, I couldn't keep going. 
It wasn't quite so hot 
when I pulled over."

"You could have woken me up," 
said Sebastian. 

"I don't think I
'm supposed to let prisoners drive 
themselves, though it doesn't really 
matter at this point."

"You'll need me to drive if we 
want to get back to the cult within 
three days," said Sebastian. 

"Why three days?" 
she asked.

"We have until then until this thing 
activates again," Sebastian 
said. "Maybe a little longer if 
the tupperware container is actually 
airtight, which I doubt."

"And you want it to activate at the 
cult."

"Yeah."

"And that's your plan?"

"More or less."
