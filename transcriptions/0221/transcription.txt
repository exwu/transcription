shots, then ducked back into the room 
as they were returned. 

Simon's gripped tightened on his shoulder. 
Behind them he could hear a wet 
sound, damp and 
slow like some large beast breathing.

Erika fed another round into her 
rifle. There was a pregnant pause, 
then she spun out, unloading another 
series of shots. Among the 
return fire there was a mangled 
scream.

"We need to go. Now." Simons 
was spat into his ear. His 
eyes were comically wide with fear. 

"You'll get shot," Sebastian 
whispered back. 

He could feel Simon's grip beginning 
to dig thin crescents into his shoulder. 
"I'll take my chances---"

Before Sebastian could react, Simons 
bolted out of the door. Startled 
gunfire roared. Erika fired three 
deliberate shots. Silence fell. 

Simons was dead, riddled with bullets
