"Nothing," she said. "I'm leaving now. 
I'll make sure you get your food. 
The nurse is on her way with new 
bandages, too."

Erika turned to leave. 

"Wait!"

"Yes?"

Sebastian grabbed the bars of his cell. 
"Don't---Can you help me change 
my bandages," he said, exhaling. 

"Uh, that's not really my sort of thing. 
But the nurse is just down the hall," she said, stepping back. 

"No, please,' he said. "Please, it has to be you."

Sebastian could see her hesitating. 
He thought she was going to refuse 
but her expression softened. 

"Fine," she said. "Wait here."

Erika left the room. 

Sebastian picked himself off the 
floor. 
In the hall outside he could hear 
Erika negotiating with the nurse. 
After the brief exchange, the 
nurse headed back down the way she 
he [[typo]] had come, Erika in the 
opposite direction.
