Sebastian shrugged on his coat and 
went to find Erika. He walked past 
the rows of houses, looking into their 
windows of yellow light. Families 
were home for the weekend, watching 
television, preparing dinner. Sebastian 
couldn't help but think of his own family, 
wondering if his parents [[aunt and uncle]] thought of him often. 
Did they even know he was no 
longer at Bedlam? He hoped that 
they still thought him there, in safe 
hands.

At the end of the street there was 
a tiny public library that doubled 
as a local tourism office. The 
lights were on inside. Sebastian 
pushed open the door and let himself 
inside.

Erika stood at the counter, speaking 
with a woman of at least 60. The 
library cum tourist information, Sebastian 
assumed. Erika gave him a nod 
and resumed her conversation 
at the counter. Sebastian nodded 
back and went to peruse the library's 
collection of books.

Sebastian scanned the bookshelves
