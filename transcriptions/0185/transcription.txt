expensive taste. 
When 
my parents passed, they left me both 
their wealth and their own extensive 
collection of art."

"At first I did not understand it---
great expense for what? For paintings 
a 'five year old could make'? But in 
grief I was desperate to understand what 
they had left to me. I consulted with 
curators and artists. They helped me 
to cultivate and understand my own 
emotional reactions to art. But as 
I begun to understand art, I 
realized that my tastes had begun to 
diverge from my parents. In both life 
and death, we truly were different people."

Simons turned from the _______ to face 
Sebastian and Irene, though he 
seemed to be looking beyond them.
