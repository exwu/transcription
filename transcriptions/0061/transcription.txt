had all left.

Sebastian recognized the man at the bars 
as one of the many guard who cycled 
through the rotation. 

"What?"

"What?" he said in an overblown 
accent. "I said di't 'urt. 
Did. It. Hurt. Your cuts."

He stared pointedly on the scars 
on his shoulders and chest, 
gaze lingering on the newest marks 
on his upper thighs. 

Sebastian felt his throat tighten. 

'"I don't see why that matters."

"D'you do it yourself? Cut yourself up, 
when we aren't looking? His voice 
was a low hiss. Sebastian shivered 
and fought the urge to cover himself. 

"Of course not. That's the most 
idiotic thing I've ever heard."

"Hey, hey," he said, holding up a 
hand. "No need to be rude. Not to the 
man who's got your food."

He held the tray out in front 
of him, wiggling it precariously 
on one hand.
