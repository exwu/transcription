Erika's face was expressionless.. Even as she looked at the wound, mottled with inflamation and stinking, there was no change. No sign of whether she had read the message described in the infected flesh. Nervously, Sebastian covered the skin with his hands.

"It's badly infected," she said, quietly. "We'll...have to go to a hospital."

Her voice was heavy. Sebastian felt his heart sink, but he knew she was right.

He pressed his face into his hands and felt tears break out from between his fingers. Across his body, half hidden by yellowing bandages his wounds seemed to burn. 

"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm sorry."
