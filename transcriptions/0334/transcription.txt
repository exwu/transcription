preferring to stay at the cabin 
and make progress on repairs. 

Sebastian began to unload the 
van. He took an armful 
of stuff into the cabin, but was 
surprised to see that Erika wasn't 
there. He stuck his head out the 
door, looking around. No sign 
of her outside either.

Sebastian was about to go around 
the grounds to look for 
her when he heard a low sound 
from up above him. He stepped 
back outside. 

Humming as she worked, Erika 
was on the roof, fastening the 
metal sheeting back down to 
the lumber [[beneath]].

Sebastian called out to her.

"Erika! you seem to be in a good 
mood today."

Blushing, Erika tried to disguise 
her humming into a cough, though 
Sebastian didn't buy it in the 
least. She could have seen 
and heard him from a mile
