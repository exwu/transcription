"Do you really want to know?"

"Well, now I'm not sure."

"Well ,apparently I'm [[some]] sort of ruined woman, feeling my shameful past, and abusing you and your kindness by stealing you from your family."

Sebastian winced. Erika laughed. "They're not entirely wrong on that one," she said. 

"You know, if you were friendlier to them, they'd probably think a little better of you."

"I'm aware, but every likes a villain in their otherwise boring lives."

"Alright then, what about me?" Sebastian said, preparing for the worst.

"They think you're a spy."

"You're kidding."

"Nope."

Sebastian groaned. "Someone's been watching too much James Bond."
