Sebastian's hand was still pressed 
against the cool stone. Hesitantly, 
he tried to pull it away.

It came free. Nothing terrible 
happened. 

"Was that 
it? Am I free now?'

"From the gate?" she said. "No. 
This is just a dream. [[ unlike your normal dreams ]] 
The gate is still there, in your 
mind. You're still there too, struggling 
against it." [[You always are, even when awake.]]

"I guess it was too good to be 
true," Sebastian said. 

He looked around. The sky and 
the ocean were the hazy blocks of color 
and sound. The pebbles of beach 
were in high resolution, though, 
radiating heat and the smell of salt. 
Sebastian bent to pick one up but 
the dark stone of the gate away 
at the substance of the dream beneath 
his fingertips.
