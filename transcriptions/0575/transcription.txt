to them---clouded and lost in the fog."

"Then, Sebastian---"

"He's defying his own nature to 
protect you. I can't imagine what it's 
like."

"I can," Erika said. "Sebastian, too, 
he knew as well."

"At this point he's not really a 
Deva anymore. There isn't really a 
word for what he is."

"That sounds like Sebastian, to 
me," she said, smiling to herself.

"What about you? Usually those 
touched by the Deva go on to 
lead lives of greatness, but to give 
his life and to get nothing but a small town hunter---"

Erika spun around, catching 
the dreamwalker by the collar of 
his shirt. She threw him the 
ground and shoved her knee into his 
chest. She reached for her hip 
and was pleased to find her pistol 
in its holster. 

"I don't suppose you'll die if 
I kill you," she said, 
cocking the gun in his face.
