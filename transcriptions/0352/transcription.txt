"I'm sorry," he stammered. "During the night
---did I?"

Erika shook her head. "It's fine."

They went about their morning routine, 
washing, making breakfast. After they 
ate, Sebastian went out to repair the 
generator. Erika stayed in, thinking 
about the night before. She touched 
her fingers to her temple. She remembered 
both the feeling of Sebastian's fingers 
on her skin, her skin on her Sebastian's 
fingers. [[though one better than the other]]

Sebastian let himself in with a blast 
of cold air. Erika shook herself 
out of her reverie.

"With all this warmer 
weather, spring is probably around the 
corner. I've been thinking, if we 
wanted, we could probably grow our 
own food, for the next winter instead
of buying all this canned stuff. And we 
could salt and dry the meat, sell the 
rest."

Sebastian kept his voice even, but 
knew Erika could feel him hoping for her 
approval.

"Yeah," she said. "We could do that."
