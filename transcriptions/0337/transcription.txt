hadn't left sooner. 

Still, he thought she'd at least have said goodbye. 

Sebastian chewed through his collection of 
library books, finding that even random 
accounts of history of their tiny town seemed 
interesting after rereading Antigone for the 
tenth time. When reading grew tiresome, he 
moved on to trying to sketch the frozen lake 
or whittle shapes into the firewood, 
but there was little to do that didn't remind 
him of Erika. He 
began to 
plot out his plan to leave in the spring. [[ shape his plan?]]

A day especially cold and snowy, Sebastian 
sat close to the fire, bundled in blankets. 
He did his best to block out any openings 
for the heat to escape, but still couldn't 
manage to keep the room warm. He was 
resigned [[resigned himself to]] to staying up the night to 
keep the fire through the night.

He was drifting between sleep and 
wakefulness, his mind empty save for 
the sound of fire in his ears. A 
crunching sound did little 
to shake him from his daze, but when it 
was followed by another, then another, he 
threw the blankets off him.

One of the villagers come to check on him? 
Or some wild animal? Or, Sebastian swallowed, 
the cult, come to take him back
