Only himself, straining hard to keep the 
door shut, blood streaming down his arms and face. 

"For Vedas, there is nothing that 
can opposte them," the dreamwalker 
said. "only themselves.

"This is not your dream---only one 
like it. But it is still the truth. One 
day you will open that door, but until 
you allow it to open, there will be 
nothing behind there but yourself."

Sebastian awoke, feeling the sting of 
fresh cuts across his arms and 
chest. He pushed them from his mind. 
They were not important now, he knew 
what they would say. 

"Sebastian, are you awake?"

Jared called back from the front of 
the van. Outside it was gray dawn. 

"Yeah," he said, letting the remnants 
of his dreams trickle slowly from his 
mind. "I'm awake."

"There are fresh bandages in the 
trunk," he said. "Food and drink too. 
Did you sleep alright?"

"Dreams, again," Sebastian replied, 
reaching over the seat for bandages. 

Jared watched him dress himself 
through the rearview mirror.
