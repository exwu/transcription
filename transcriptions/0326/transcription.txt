Erika woke up with the dawn. Sebastin slept like the dead on the bed across the room. Usually she caught fragments of strange dreams as he slept, but they seemed to have left him alone for the night. 

In the daylight there was much to want from the cabin. A smell of must pervaded the air---she would have to see whether the damp had progressed to mold. It was cramped, furniture a little too large for the space, which was filled with clutter. The doors and winow frames fit poorly, warped by humidity and temperature. 

But Sebastian's immediate affection for the place made these problems seem fixable and small. 

Erika sighed and started on cleaning the place up.
