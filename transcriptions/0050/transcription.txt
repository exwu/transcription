eyes. 

The stone gate, Sebastian threw his arms 
over his eyes as the wind began to howl 
around him. 

He stood on a precipes of rocks, 
miles above an empty wasteland of dust 
and rocks. There was nothing but barren
 sand as far as the eye could see. Only 
his tower and the gate. 

The gate. Desperation gripped him and 
before he could stop himself, he 
found himself slammed against the door, 
pushing at immovable stone. The need 
to open the door overrode any sense of 
self preservation. Sebastian felt 
his bones grind against each other, 
muscles screaming in pain. His own 
voice was lost, howling with the wind. 

It was impossible, he thought. He would 
never open the door. 

The wind abated. He felt his muscles relax. 
Slowly he slid does the door, limp. But he 
could not convince himself to let it go. 

He looked up. The stone gate towered 
above him, lone feature on the stone 
tableau, lone feature of the stone wasteland.
