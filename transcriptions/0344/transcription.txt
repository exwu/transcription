the hardest part is done."

Erika laughed heartily. Sebastian 
smiled through the grime of deer, 
happy to have her back.

They fried the best cuts of deer on 
a pan over an open fire, 
and washed them down with the 
cheap beer Sebastian had bought at 
the town's general store. Halfway 
through the evening, the power died, 
but their bellies were too full with 
warm food to venture out into the 
cold to fix it.

Sebastian sat by the fire, squinting 
to read in the flickering light. 
Erika lounged on the couch, watching 
him.

Sebastian looked up, seeing Erika 
staring at him. Her eyes, dark, flickered 
with reflections from the fire. 

"What are you thinking about?" he 
asked.

Erika took a moment to answer, 
as if carefully sorting [[sifting]] through her thoughts.
