Early in the morning, they 
packed him and a week's worth 
of supplies into the back of two vans 
along with a team of six. As Sebastian 
clambered into what was indicated 
to be his seat, he felt a wave of 
deja vu wash through him. [[ maybe his blood stains are still in this particular van ]] 
At least they wouldn't be 
putting a bag over his head this time. 

As the sun began to rise and preparations 
began to wrap up, Sebastian began to 
look around nervously. Where was Erika? 
Somehow the thought of leaving 
without her made his guts begin 
to twist with anxiety...

There she was. At the last moment, 
she climbed into the van, flopped into 
the seat beside him, and prompty 
fell asleep. [[ she should be blasting music into her ears to drown out the others' thoughts; also, people are uncomfortable having her nearby. ]]

So then all eight of them were present 
and accounted for. They pulled out from 
the small lot of vans and out past 
the concrete walls of the 
compound and onto the open road.
