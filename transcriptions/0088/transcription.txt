"What happened?'

The dreamwalker was wearing Michelle's face this time. 

"You don't dreram much, do you? I thought I might catch you in a normal dream, but you don't seem to have them. I had to make do and bring you to someone else's. You didn't need to bring that with you, though."

She pointed to something behind Sebastian. He looked behind him The stone gat was still there, looking very much out of place in the midst of the pebbled beach. 

((Beh, these dream sequences are terrible))

Sebastian stood unsteadily, leveraging himself against the gate. Now that he was standing, he looked up at the gate, seeing it properly for the first time.

It was carved from gray black stone, rough hewn and without adornment. It was freestanding on pillars twenty feet tall. [[ It seemed ludicrous that he could ever hope to move even one of its giant doors.]]
