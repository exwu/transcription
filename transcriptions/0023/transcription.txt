Just a normal day then.

 Sebastian lay in bed unmoving, wondering 
when whoever his newest caretaker would 
notice him. [[ put before ]] He was restrained to the 
bed by both IV and handcuffs.

He wasn't alone in the infirmary. 
He recognized several of the men 
who had brought him here. They 
seemed to be in worse shape than 
him, but there weren't as many 
as he thought there would be. 
The conflict 
in the cornfield mustn't have been 
too bad then. 

Someone in the room noticed him 
looking around and called the doctor 
over. 

"You're awake much sooner than 
I thought," she said. She was a 
woman in middle age, streaks 
of gray hair and a kind face. 

"Where am I?" he asked, swallowing 
to clear the grime from his throat. 

"This is the home of the Temple 
of the Grand Unification," she said.
