to decipher the message backwards,

He banged on the driverside

hands immediately reaching for her

"Yeah," she said, voice sticky with 
thirst. She pushed open the car door 
and took the bottle from him, drinking 
greedily. Sebastian went back to the 
trunk and grabbed another, which they 
split thirstily. 

"How long have we been here?' Sebastian 
asked as Erika 
crushed the newly emptied bottle.
