((or)) ((What role did she have with all 
this))

Quickly, as attention was focused on 
Carberry's removal, she shucked the black 
robes and knelt down at the end of 
the row, as if she had been there all along.

"I guess I should say sorry for shooting 
you."

Erika set the tray of food down 
on the small table they had allowed him 
in his cell. It had 
become a daily habit to visit him after 
they finished taking pictures of him. 
Something 
to look forward to help him get through 
the process. 

"Really it's the stepping on me and 
rolling me over in the mud that gets to me. 
That and the 'hold your own tourniquet' 
business." 

Erika winced. "Sorry, about that, too."
