take her place in the line but Sebastian 
pulled her aside. 

"What does it say, on my back?"

"Now's not the time," she said, pushing 
past him.

"No, it's important. What does it stay?"

She stopped, looked down and read 
through the smear of blood.

"Neither shall bring freedom, 
neither shall bring death."

[[maybe change this to something about her being about to shoot him]]

She looked at Sebastian oddly, and 
seemed as if she wanted to ask him 
a question, but the driver was issuing 
orders and there were more pressing 
matters at hand. 

As they assembled, readying weapons 
and preparing for battle, Sebastian 
skipped backwards in the trench. 

Normally the things written 
into his skin meant little to nothing, 
to him but occasionally they were 
somewhat interpretable. If Sebastian 
was reading this one right, neither 
outcome of this battle would mean 
anything to him. If he was wrong, 
well, then, it was still a prime 
opportunity to escape.
