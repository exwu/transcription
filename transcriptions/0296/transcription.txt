of the feather were slowly unfurling in the sunlight. The eyes of the crocodile headed woman glinted with far too much life for simple stone. A panic welled up in his throat. The images of his dream, Erika, heart torn out, was all too vivid in his mind. 

"The moment you shoot they will kill you," Freeman hissed. 

"I don't care," she said. "I've beendead for a long time."

"Are you worried, Freeman, about death? What it's like to die?" she said. "You're wondering if I know---thinking that I must not, because I kill epople on a regular basis, and I'm about to kill you. But I do know what it's like to die. It's agony. Are you prepared Freeman? You and I will experience it together."
