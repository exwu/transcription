After a few years I gave up on ever getting 
better. 
I made a mistake 
and let it take over my life, even though 
when I think back now, there was no reason 
why it needed to. I've been trying to 
undo it ever since." 

"And this is part of that?" 

"I guess so," said Sebastian. 

"Then congratulations," said Michelle. 
"I hope you get better soon." 

"Yeah," said Sebastian, feeling the ache 
of five years worth of scars.

Another night, another dream of the 
stone gate. This time he 
awoke with twin cuts on his forearms. 

The heart of the infinite 
fields, mindless

Given thought 
by the aspirations of machine and man.

Sebastian called the guards for the 
nurse and they quickly bandages the 
new wounds.
