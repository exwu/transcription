Sebastian sighed. "Mostly forgiven now. I've been through worse."

He saw Erika's hands tighten and she looked away. 

"Though you seem almost like a different person lately." 

"Side effect of being an Empath," she said. "I pick up a little too much from the peopel around me."

SHe shuffled away from him, guilt obvious.

"Won't you sit down?" Sebastian asked. "There's only the bed for now but if they gave me table they'll eventally let me have a chair."

Erika accepted, though she sat as far from him as possible.

"I'll see what I can do," she said. 

"Thank you," Sebastian said, smiling. "It's good to have someone on the outside that's more or less normal."

"So you've met Master Freeman," she said. 

Sebastian nodded. "He didn't want to have much to do with me. I guess that's a good thing."
