confidence that I won't end up dead 
in a ditch somewhere. Why 
did you change your mind?"

(( Why did he tell them in the first place? ))

It seemed that Sebastian would refuse to 
answer, but Jared refused to move the car 
until he did. At last, he said. 

"It's the right thing to do."

Jared scowled. "I guess that's as good as 
I'm going to get. 
But if I get the feeling that 'the 
right thing to do' includes running 
for the hills, I'll 
tranquilize you and take you back to the 
facility."

"You don't have to worry," said Sebastian. "I'll do 
as promised."

They set off down the mountain roads. 
Sebastian recognized the old growth 
trees, the colors and shapes of these 
hills. Perhaps it was no coincidence 
that the place Erika had chosen as 
their home was less than 
a day's drive from the world tree.
