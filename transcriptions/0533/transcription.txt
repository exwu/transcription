same. Doom and gloom."

"You're paying a lot of blood for not 
much in return," Jared remarked. 

"I know," Sebastian replied.

The gray of dawn wouldn't seem 
to leave. Sebastian had taken over 
for Jared driving, who was snoring 
now, sprawled out on 
the backseat. The roads were growing 
windy now, snaking along the curves 
of the mountainsides. Old growth forests 
surrounded them on every side. 

Only thirty miles now. Within 
the hour, they would be at Stone 
Temple Forest. 

Sebastian blasted cool air into his 
face. Despite having never been 
here, he felt the air was unseasonably 
warm. Under his bandages he felt 
sweaty and itchy. He felt unsettled, 
unable to rest in his own skin. 

If he was something more than 
mortal, he didn't feel it now. 
If fate were some changeable, 
malleable thing, it seemed so far 
out of reach.
