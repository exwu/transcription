but as he repeats the same experiments 
again and again, he is coming to 
realize that my conclusion is the only one that can be drawn.

Marcus flew into a rage today. He is 
saying that we, Kent and I and the other 
researchers, have changed. That working 
with the heart has made us different 
somehow. He could not tell me how or 
why, but he has threatened to take 
our children and bring them home. I 
tried to reason with him but he was 
adamant. He says that on Sunday he'll 
be leaving, with or without me.

In brighter news, Kent has 
come around, and now acknowledges that 
we have ventured into territory wholly 
unknown. He has taken [[to]] the task of 
mapping it with great fervor. Lately 
he has taken to saying 'since we 
have no hope of understanding its 
mechanisms, we must endeavor to 
understand the heart itself.' He is looking 
for some way to communicate with it.
