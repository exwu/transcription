like that's what happened to them."

"And to our guys, up ahead?" 

"Probably." 

"Jesus."

Jared knelt by the unresponsive man, trying to rouse him with slaps, water. He would respond, but wouldn't break from his stupor. 

"Jared?"

"What, Sebastian?" he said, hauling the other[[s]]  from the truck, trying to rouse them. 

"You should probably turn back now," Sebastian said, staring into the prone man's lifeless eyes. "Otherwise the same might happen to you." 

"It might happen to you as well."

Sebastian shook his head. "It won't."

"Future vision?" asked Jared. Sebastian nodded. 

"I've got orders, you know. To keep you under my protection. But I won't lie, I'm not willing to die for this work. But at the same time, if I let you go and you get loose and go destroy the world or something..."

"I don't think I'm the world destroying kind. The [[carseats]], maybe."
