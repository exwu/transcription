The building they brought him too [[typo]] 
was warmer and better constructed: lighting 
fixtures instead of bare bulbs, 
carpet over the concrete floors. The 
long corridor branched off into kitchens, 
dining rooms, offices cramped 
with desks. Sebastian's guards didn't 
let him linger to look long. 

The corridor opened up to a small 
foyer. 
The door at the end was 
constructed of heavy wood in sharp 
contrast to the cheapness of the 
construction of the rest of the building. 
Some symbology was painted in fading 
red over the dark wood. The 
guards knocked twice on the door 
before stepping back. Sebastian 
could smell a faint trace of incense. 

The door opened, seemingly on its 
own. The guards wheeled him into 
the room. 

The room was lavishly decorated. Thick 
rugs covered the hard wood floors.
