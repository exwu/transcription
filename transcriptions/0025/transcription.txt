The building they brought him to was warmer and better constructed: lighting fixtures instead of bear bulbs, carpet over the concrete floors. The long corridor branched off into kitchens, dining rooms, offices cramped with desks. Sebastian's guards didn't let him linger to look long. 

The corridor opened up toa small foyer. The door at teh end was constructed of heavy wood in sharp contrast to the cheapness of the construction of the rest of the building. Some symbology was painted in fading red over the dark wood. The guards knocked twice on the door before stepping back. Sebastian could smell a faint trance of incense. 

the door opened, seemingly on its own. The guards wheeled him into the room. 

The room was lavishly decorated. Thick rugs covered the hard wood floors.
