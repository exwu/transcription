"Careful now," he said, pushing 
the tray through the slot. Sebastian 
grabbed it. While he did so the, the 
guard reached out with his free hand, 
grabbing at Sebastian's hair. He pulled him against the bars. 

"Charles, now what would your wife 
think if she saw you...disrespecting 
the Master's property like this?"

Charles withdrew his hand as if 
struck. The tray clattered to the ground, 
spilling over him. Charles stumbled away from 
the bars, swearing.

"Fucking snitch," he snarled. 

"Mhm," said Erika dismissively f
rom where she stood at the bars. "Now 
run along and fetch Master Augur 
here a new lunch before I find 
some more things to snitch about."

Charles stormed out, cussing. Erika 
watched him go disdainfully. 

Sebastian sank to his knees. 

"And what do you want?" he asked, 
trying to keep the tremors in his knees 
from moving up into his voice.
