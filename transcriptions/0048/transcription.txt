"Any relation?" Sebastian asked. 

Sasha was pleased he had noticed. "Yes. My late 
mother. And Master Freeman's sister."

"I'm sorry for your loss," Sebastian said. 

"I barely knew her," said Sasha. 
"Master Freeman raised me as his own." 

"I see," said Sebastian. 

"Some new recruits will be arriving 
in the next few days," said Sasha. "When 
they arrive you all can go through the 
process together. Please read through the 
writings in the meanwhile." 

Sebastian got out of his bed and made 
a gesture of picking the book up from the 
slot. 

"Thank you, Sasha," he said. 

"You're welcome," he said happily. "To 
be honest, we should have offered to have 
you join us much earlier. I'm truly sorry 
for the time you've spent alone in here."

Sasha gave a quick bow and excused himself. 
With little else to do, Sebastian took the book 
and began to read.
