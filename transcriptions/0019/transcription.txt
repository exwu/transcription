More likely than anything else it was 
his own. 

Sebastian began to walk. Eventually 
if he continued in this direction he 
should find the road. From there, 
civilization, and then freedom. 

A small part of his mind 
whispered doubts into his ear. It 
was miles and miles since they had 
passed as much as a gas station on 
the drive here. And they had said 
that their base was nearby. Any 
passing cars were more 
likely to belong to his captors than 
not.

Infection, the voice whispered. Blood 
loss. Hunger, thirst, exposure.

Sebastian pushed it from his mind. 
Even if there were a bettter chance 
he ended up dead than free, 
it was still worth it. 

Sebastian walked further. The 
sun had began to sink beneath the horizon. 
He thought he'd have hit the 
road by now, but there was no sign 
of it. HIs feet grew numb, then 
achy again.
