monumental task of both organizing this 
expedition and comforting two grieving 
children. I asked them if they wanted 
to return to their home in Middleton, 
but they didn't want to leave their uncle. 
Their love for him is one of the 
few comforts in this trying time. 

Enough of this sadness. The sooner I 
can heal from this, the sooner I can be 
there for my children and the sooner I 
can resume my duties to the expedition. 
Kent is still pushing forward through this 
tragedy. He has taken my suggestion [[ and  ]] hired a genetic 
engineer to come on to examine the 
symbiotic bacteria of the roots. Perhaps 
some can be engineered to be sympathetic 
with our own nervous systems.
