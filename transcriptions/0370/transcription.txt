The sudden tenderness of her expression seemed to surprise him. He calmed.

"I never meant to let it get so out of hand."

As soon as she was unstuck the first of the tape, a foul stench filled the air. Sebastian panicked again, pushing her hand away from him. 

"You can't---you can't read it. Promise me that you won't."

"I need to see if it's infected," she said.

"I know, just---promise me you won't try to read it."

Sebastian bit his lip to keep from crying out as the bandages came away, pulling and sucking at the skin. The skin was inflamed, weeping equal parts pus and blood. Sebastian's hands hovered over the wound, obscuring the whole of the message. Erika gently nudged his hands away to inspect the wound.

"It won't stop bleeding," he said, tears coming to his eyes. "It's been weeks but it won't heal."
