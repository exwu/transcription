it with her. Through this shared feeling 
we bonded. Though it was not quite love, 
we fell into it. In the 
shadow of her first creation, I waited 
for her next.

"But there was no second creation [[ sculpture ]]. One 
day, I went to her studio. It was empty, 
ransacked. Her tools, her belongings were 
gone. I ran to that tiny gallery. The 
sculpture was gone as well."

"The next years of my life were lost 
in a haze of desperation to find her, to find the sculpture. 
The search was fruitless for many years, 
but wealth brings answers. After 
many years, I learned of what had become 
of her and her work. They had been 
spirited away, by an organization that 
referred to as the Foundation."
