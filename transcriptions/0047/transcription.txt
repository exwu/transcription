offer might be.

"So, then what is the Temple offering?"

"Membership," said Sasha. "You've been here a while now. You haven't had much chance to see what daily life is like, but if you're interested, we'll walk you through it and show you our teachings. Then, at the end, if you're interested in our goal, you'll go through the rites and be a full fledged member."

"And you'll let me out of this cell?"

"Of course," said Sasha cheerily. "Though the master will still want daily documentation of your prophecies. But otherwise ou'll be free to go about the compound like the rest of us." 

Sebastian wanted to ask about outside of the compound, but kept the question to himself.

"So how will this work?" he asked.

"Well, to start with, I can give you this," said Sasha. He placed a black hardbound book between the bars of Sebastian's cell. "It's writings by Master Freeman and Master Bertholt, the previous leader of the Temple."
