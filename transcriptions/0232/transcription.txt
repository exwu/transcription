one at random. 

"Humanoid-844: Tumeroids..."

[[ wow am I terrible at picking random numbers. Apparently I always choose the same one.]]

Humanoid, Sebastian thought. There 
had been another number. Quickly he 
thumbed through the files...

"Humanoid 973: Empath.

"Access to H-973 is restricted to 
agents with security clearance below 
level 3. H-973 is to 
be kept in a standard cell 
equipt [[equipped]] with psychic shielding, though 
there is little evidence that it has 
any effect..."

Sebastian stopped reading. 
Immediately he regretted finding 
the file at all. It was all to easy to 
picture Erika here, locked away in one 
of these small cells somewhere in the maze. 
If the mission failed, no doubt that's what was 
waiting for her---in a pre-prepared cage with 
psychic shielding.

"Is that my file?" Erika asked, as 
intuitive as always. Sebastian nodded 
guiltily. "Give it here."
