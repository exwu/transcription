sides, blinding him as he walked the 
narrow trail.*The nature of the curse was 
that it would steal from him slowly 
his friends, his health, his family 
so that his path would narrow  [[ but why does Erika stick around? ]]
until it came to an end. He would walk 
the path that fate intended him and 
then die when his purpose was fulfilled. 

But there were other paths, out there, 
in the mists. All the time, it seemed, 
he would cross them, but could not follow. 
To do so would be to lose himself 
to the fog. And somehow, he knew 
the cost would be his very self, that 
fragile thing trapped within the mists. 

[[each pass near their entwining 
vapors sent a chill, a horrible deadness 
down through his skin, into his bones]]

(( Next scene is Erika in the lab, but first some more fluff in the middle of the night ))

Erika woke up in the middle of the night.
