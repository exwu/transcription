the car, standing there lamely as she pushed 
the door shut behind him.

"Be well," he heard her say 
behind the glass before driving off.

"Stay safe," he said, far too late for 
her to hear.

The wind howled loudly along the 
now empty mountain road. Sebastian 
shrunk into his coat, trying to convince 
himself the shivers were only from cold. 
From the bag, he pulled the handgun's last 
magazine and practiced loading and 
unloading it as Erika had taught him. 
He put the gun back in the bag. 

It was a long walk into town. He was 
feeling stronger after his visit to the hospital 
than he had in weeks, but still he doubted 
his ability to make the five mile walk 
up and down the foothills, especially if 
he stayed out of sight off the road. 

But there was nothing else to be done. 
Sebastian began the trek to town.

It took much longer than he thought
