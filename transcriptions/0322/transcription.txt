for old favorites. He saw a substantial 
collection fo classics, a smattering of 
obscure fiction he had never heard of 
before. The vast majority were the 
strange manuals and nonfiction that 
accumulate in abandoned 
bookshelves everywhere. 

Sebastian picked a book off the 
shelf at random and began to read, 
though he could[[n't]] help his attention being 
drawn to Erika's conversation.

"Is that your man? I see what 
you mean. And he's so young too. A 
bit of fresh him would do him a world 
of good."

"That's the plan, Ms. Grady."

"Oh, and he's so thin. You know what, 
forget about the rent. Just get that 
place fixed up and keep it in good shape. 
You're already doing us such a favor."

"You're too kind, Mrs. Grady. We'll 
take good care of it."

Erika came over to find him.

"The fishing birds of the Pacific 
Northwest? You didn't strike me as the 
wildlife kind."

"No, not really. What was all 
that about?"
