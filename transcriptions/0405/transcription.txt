half driven off the road.

Sebastian felt his blood run cold 
and his mind go numb. Somehow, 
suddenly, he was at the van, gasping 
for breath, limbs screaming with 
soreness, pushed beyond their limits. But 
Sebastian barely noticed. He slammed 
himself in the car's body. There 
were bullets in the car's body, 
its windows were shattered. Sebastian 
heaved open the door. There was blood, but no body.

Its driver's side door had been flung 
open. A crash through the underbrush left 
a path of broken brambles down 
the sloping side of the road. Forgetting 
the coming night, Sebastian followed 
it, slipping down the litter of dead 
leaves.

In the bed of a dried stream the 
trail came to an end. Against the 
bark of a nearby tree there was a smear 
of dark blood. On the ground, the 
rifle and the smell of vomit.
