were well-founded. You[[emph]] were not converted 
and Sasha's actions almost caused the 
heart irreparable harm."

Sebastian quickly looked around the 
room for Sasha but did not see him. 
Normally it seemed he followed Freeman 
around like a shadow. 

"Both my disappointment and yours, Master," 
said Sebastian. 

There was a flicker of surprise on Freeman's 
face. 

"So you do wish to serve the Temple's cause." 

Sebastian lowered his gaze. "Yes, though 
the heart did ultimately reject me, 
I still saw the endless fields. I wish to 
aid the cult in the only way that I can."

"Then those prophecies---the latest, of 
the great tree? Do you know their meaning?"

Freeman's voice was a passioned whisper. 
His eyes were wide with anticipation. 
Sebastian felt said prophecies itch 
under his clothes.
