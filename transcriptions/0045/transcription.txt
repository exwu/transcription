take it. 

Erika made sure he had grabbed it, 
turned on her heel, and left.

The next day, a 
stranger brought his lunch. The next 
day, a stranger came as well. 
The third and 
fourth day, Sebastian could 
entertain that she was busy, but 
as days turned to weeks and weeks 
to months, it seemed that she 
was no longer interested in visiting him. 

After the arrival of this realization, 
time passed quickly, without 
discrimination from day to day. Sebastian 
drifted quickly into his old habit 
of sleeping to pass away the time. 

Sebastian lazily scratched at a healing 
wound, day dreaming. He had just woken 
up from some dream, barely remembered. 
He recalled stuff relating to the brainwashing 
thing [[put in specifics]] but nothing else. 
Though tantalizingly half remembered, he 
preferred these dreams to the others 
that routinely haunted his sleep.
