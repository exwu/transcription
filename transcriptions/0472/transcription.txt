On the screen, Dr. Weaver reached 
out to touch Erika. Sebastian saw 
her strain to break free, falling still 
as soon as contact was made. The man, 
Gillian, was speaking to the woman, 
but stopped suddenly. An expression of

meek demeanor, came across his face. 
With a howl of fury, he ran at 
Weaver, pinning her to the wall as 
he attempted to strangle her. Behind 
them, Erika's body thrashed on 
the gurney. 

"The whole incident lasted 
less than a minute. Dr. Weaver 
manages to free herself and immediately 
calls for a psychohazard team. She 
and Anderson and the 
rest of the technicians evacuate 
the area."
