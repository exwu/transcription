if Erika could not?

The wiry scrawl of lacerations crept 
up to his hands and feet. Pain seemed less 
a feeling than a separate entity, 
thrashing within his skin. 
He could feel his consciousness slipping 
as the wounds began to deepen. With a 
shudder, he let them overtake him---they 
were not important now. 

There was something left of her, beyond 
the role fate had assigned her. 
It was not too late to find it.
