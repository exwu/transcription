pointed out the obvious: she shot you, 
she sold you out, if it weren't for 
her you would be free. But even so, 
Sebastian couldn't find it in him to hate 
her. 

(( all this is too tell not show-y ))

But why? She wasn't conventionally 
attractive--stocky and well-built, 
about as feminine as any of the 
mercenaries she worked with. Sebastian 
had had a handful of girlfriends before 
the Auguring had started, an 
age ago. They were all pretty much 
opposite to her in every way. 

In the end, he decided it was because 
she had treated him as another person. 
After years as a zoo exhibit, 
having 
someone to talk to made him feel 
human again. He had started to believe 
them, that he was little more than 
a prize to be jockeyed over. When 
he was around her, he felt real again.

Sebastian awoke suddenly.
