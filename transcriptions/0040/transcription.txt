They sat in silence. Sebastian watched 
the steam slowly drift away as it grew cold.

"Erika, what is 
this place? It's a cult, isn't it?"

Erika stifled a laugh. "Of course. 
Can you think 
of any other[[scratch]] sane reason to be living out 
in the middle of a cornfield?"

"But, the people seem so normal. Dr. 
____, you. Even the guys who took me 
from the hospital seem like normal 
military types."

"That's because they're just normal 
mercenaries the cult hired. Some of them 
have actually joined since but most work for money."

"Then what about you and Dr. ____?"

"I'm in it because the alternative is 
spending life in a cage. As for Dr. ____, 
well, Freeman has a way of persuading 
people that's not like your average 
cult's."
