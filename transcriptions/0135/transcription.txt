leave footprints in the mud, pry the corn from their stalks, take shelter from the sun, we give some of ourselves to the heart and the heart gives some of itself to us. When we introduce new genes to its symbiotes, when we touch it with bare skin, we let it give us vision, we exchange bigger portions. We give it seed in our hearts. 

But this is not the ecosystem we are part of. [[ this is not our home ecosystem, or something ]] For the heart cannot understand our individuality, the higher thoughts that we consider to define us, though it tries. I theorize that some other heart must exist somewhere, that connects our true sevesl, in our self contradictions and self destruction and self absorption. But likely, it is nothing like the heart of these fields. It must take some other form, founded on some other tree of life.
