if it means leaving you like this, here, alone."

"I won't be alone," he said, looking 
upwards. "I am the world tree now, 
in the soul of every living thing, every 
neuron of the human mind, every 
thought voiced and unvoiced. Yours included. This is your 
gift to me, and freedom is 
mine to you. Use it well."

"It's a heavy burden to bear," she said, 
smiling sadly. 

"You'll bear it well. I can see it already," he said. "Be 
well, Erika."

"Thank you, Sebastian. 
For everything. Without you, I---I don't 
even know what I would be without you. 
And now we have to say goodbye."

"Only in some ways," he said. "In 
others we will never be apart. Goodbye, 
Erika."

"Goodbye, Sebastian."
