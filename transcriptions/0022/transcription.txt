"But freedom is worth getting worked up over."

"You don't need to tell me that,"

She stood and left him alone to 
grit through the pain. 

"I've got him. Head down the 
road, I'll meet you there. Then let's 
get him back as soon as possible. 
He needs some medical attention. 
If Master Freeman asks what happened, 
tell him it was the Foundation."

Sebastian woke up in a hospital

stuffed with cotton and his mouth was 
as dry as the desert.
