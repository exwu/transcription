Erika shook her head. "Not anymore. It's all over now."

[[ Jared didn't seem to believe her. "Do you think you'd be alive still, if it wasn't?" ]]

"I suppose you're right. Up ahead people are coming back to, if the radio is to be believed." Jared relaxed again. "There were a couple of dicey moments back then. I blanked out for a moment back there. One second I was driving along, the next crashed against the tree. I thought that was the end of everything."

"Nope. Everything is under control now."

"Thanks to you?"
