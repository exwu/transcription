but under Freeman's gaze he felt 
paralyzed. Sebastian walked to the 
center of the room. 

It was too late now, he thought as 
he looked around the room. 
Freeman and the others 
were watching expectantly. 
He questioned whether it was worth 
it, freedom from his cell or his 
freedom of thought. Somehow he had 
been so sure that he wouldn't have 
to choose. Why had he been so certain?

Because of the dreams, because of 
the prophecies. [[Because of Erika]] A solution had seemed 
just out of reach, but he had 
never managed to grab it. 

Why was there never anything he 
could Do? Sebastian reached up and 
grabbed the roots.

Blue sky. The sun warmed soil. In 
the distance a tower of thunderheads 
released a deluge of rain. He 
felt it batter against him though 
the sky above him was clear.
