She was a post-doc studying interpersonal 
psychological phenomena. She reached 
out to the temple to study their 
community, and was joining their recruitment 
process for observation. She thought they might be
 concerned with the scientific inquiry, as 
many other...tightly woven communities...
did, but no none she'd spoken with seemed 
to care much. In other ways the temple 
seemed strange---no fanatics, members 
were not overwhelmingly vulnerable or 
disenfranchised. She was excited to learn 
more.

Sebastian wondered what she thought of 
him. The cult had kindly lent him 
some normal clothes as opposed to the 
hospital gowns he had grown accustomed 
to wearing in his cell. A turtleneck 
sweater kept the scars creeping up his 
neck hidden from view. In theory 
he was no different from anyone else, but 
he could push away the 
suspicion that somehow she could tell 
he was different. 

The table of recruits had filled 
as they had spoken. Sebastian
