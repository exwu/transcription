of the way you feel about me. But I 
can't answer 
that question. What do I feel without you? 
I don't know. I don't know if I feel 
anything at all. [ Before the cult, I was only 
myself for minutes at a time, blinking 
in and out of existence, with hands all 
over me, all the time. And at the 
cult I wasn't much more than a human 
weapon---it's all I wanted to be. Now 
that I'm with you, I don't know what 
to do.]

Erika put her gloves back on and wrapped 
the blanket around herself. 

"But at the same time, alone here, 
with you, is the happiest 
I've ever been. [[ It's the first time I'm happy as I am.]] And I'll 
do whatever I can to keep it that way."

Erika curled up on the couch to 
watch the fire until she fell asleep. 
She expected Sebastian to return to his 
bed to do the same, but he never did. Just
pulled his own blankets from the couch 
and fell asleep sitting next to her.

The next morning, Erika awoke before 
Sebastian. She tried to leave the couch 
without waking him, but he started 
away as soon as she shifted  [[unintelligible]].
