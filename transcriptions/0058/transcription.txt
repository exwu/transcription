brotherhood and grand purpose, had 
stepped up to take its place.

As he listened to them swap stories 
of the life [[their lives]] before the Temple, Sebastian 
found himself withdrawing from the them. 
What if they asked him how he came 
to be here? Would he say he was 
imprisoned in Bedlam's hospital before 
being stolen here? Would he tell 
them about the prophecies writing 
them into his skin? Their 
stories, terrible jobs, ex boyfriends 
and girlfriends, absent parents, 
made him feel unreal and strange.

But really was his story so different? 
He had lived a normal life until 
it was stricken by inexplicable 
tragedy. He had lost the last 
few years of his life to it, and 
though he still held on to 
the hope he might return to it one 
day, in the meanwhile, what was 
there to fill the void?
