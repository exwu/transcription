of repairs quickly. Come second snowfall, Erika had already refit all the doors and windows and patched the gaps in their walls. Sebastian rapidly found himself becoming master electrician trying to deal with the number of problems the cabin's various generators regularly put up. For a while it seemed the number of issues they had to deal with were endless, until suddenly, they were gone. 

Sebastian sat in his seat b the fire, book in his lap, but dozing more than reading. His attention drifted to Erika, seated on the window sill. She  had been attempting to carve something froma scrap of fire wood, but her hands were still now, her attention arrested by something out across the lake. 

"Do you hear that?" she said, suddenly. 

Sebastian listene, but heard nothing but the crackle of the fire. He stood, looking out over the lake, but there was no movement either.

"No, hear what?"

Erika looked up into Sebastian's eye. He thought he saw a flicker of uncertainty.
