thumb, I will not hesitate to 
shoot you and do so. Or rather, 
Sebastian will." 

Sebastian experimentally closed and 
reopened the safety. "Normally I'm 
opposed to these sort of things, 
but he did try to 
'add me to his collection'." [[I've had rather too much of that lately.]]

"Maybe it was a bad idea to give 
you a gun," said Erika, wincing. [[ eyeing him carefully ]]

"Maybe. Where are Irene and the others?"

[[ They're not coming, they traded you for information. Sucks to suck, Sebastian. ]]

"On their way down," she said. 
"Clearing our way out. The 
plan is to rendezvous with them 
once we grab the artifact."

"No!" Sebastian blurted out. [[Erika looked at him strangely.]]
 "We need to 
go somewhere else first. There are 
records, somewhere. 
Before we go to the artifact, 
we need to go there first." 

Erika frowned. "Is this something 
you augured?"
