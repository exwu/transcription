His steps faltered as new wounds 
drove themselves into his arms and legs. 
But though the pain was like 
a physical force weighing on his 
limbs, he fought to make his way 
over to the world tree. Erika did not 
move to help him, and instead, stood 
gazing up into the world 
tree. Above them, its branches, 
like ghostly tendrils, reached upwards 
into the darkness. Its fruit, bulbous 
and glistening with unearthly lights, sat 
nestled in the crooks of its limbs, 
seeming too heavy for its thin boughs. 

"You know what will happen, if you 
touch it, don't you, Erika? It won't be 
just you, the whole of humanity will go 
with you," he said. "No more thoughts, 
no more feelings."

"I know," she said. "That's why I 
told you not to come after me. 
You 
would never stand for it."

"But you waited for me," he said. 

She turned to face him  at last.
