go. She opened her eyes. They were wet 
with tears. 

She opened her mouth as if to speak, 
but said nothing, as if unable to find the 
words. 

On unsteady limbs, she left 
the chamber. Freeman met her, 
murmured something quietly to her. 
He then reached behind her and pulled 
the hood over her head. He directed her 
to stand with the others in red robes. 

A murmur ran through the recruits. 
Curiosity, confusion. What had happened? The 
next in line appraoched the roots 
with some eagerness. 

The same happened. Just a moment 
holding the roots and he stepped from 
the center, tears in his eyes. 

[[ Michelle should be a skeptic. How does a skeptic end up with the recruits? ]]

"What was it like?" someone blurted out. 
But no one chastised him. 

"It was... sublime. 
It's like nothing I've ever seen before, 
or will ever see again."

"One day we may see it again," said 
Freeman, taking him by the shoulder.
