up and over the barb wire walls before clambering over herself. Once on the other side, they began the long trek to the road. 

It was nearly dawn when they finally made it to the other trucks [[ truck, singular ]]. Sebastian's feet were numb with soreness from stumbling over the rough desert rocks. The new wound on his collar bone itched like fire, caked in blood. Upon reaching the van, Sebastian collapsed into his seat, though he couldn't rest quite yet. 

He climbed over the back seat and into the trunk, rummaging around until he found a plastic container which they had used some days earlier to store food. He unstrapped the bag from his shoulder and gently lowered it into the container. Sebastian pulled the lid over it and forced it shut. Some more rummaging and he found a roll of duct tape. Fastidiously, Sebastian taped lid to container, then wrapping it round several extra times for good measure.
