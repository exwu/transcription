I have something in mind, but perhaps 
communicating is not the right word for it. 

I can tell Marcus is serious about 
his threat to leave. The last thing 
I want is to leave my work, but 
I can't bear to be away from 
Maria [[Maya]] and little Sasha. If they go, 
I must go with them. Freeman [[ Kent ]] will 
have to manage without me.

It's strange. Prior to all 
this, when we first arrived here, if 
Marcus had proposed that he and the 
kids return home, I would have had 
no problem staying behind. But now, 
even the thought seems unbearable. 
Paradoxically, the more I am entrenched 
in my work, the stronger I feel the 
impetus to leave it. But stronger, too, grows 
my sadness to leave it behind.

((maybe F. just tells her he left)) [[nah.]]

Marcus is dead. Kent found him, 
cold, in the chamber of the heart. 
There were no marks on him. I do 
not know what took him from me.
