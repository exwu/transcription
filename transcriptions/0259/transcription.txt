like a person, but when in reality, there's 
no internal experience. Just a machine, perceiving 
and reacting, with nothing inside."

Sebastian looked up to 
Erika. She nodded her agreement, slowly 
and without any show of emotion. 

[[ it's a bit wordy and awkward; maybe find some better way to convey this idea ]]

"But you're not that," said Sebastian. 
"You told me yourself, you hate the things 
you do around Freeman, in the cult. 
There's something in there that wants to 
be a better person.  You're more than what 
he makes you do."

The two of them watched parents usher 
crying child and her mute younger sibling 
out the diner. She hiccuped quietly in 
her mother's arms while her parents paid 
the waitress their dues in politeness. 

"It's a kind thought, Sebastian. But 
that's not how it works. I only hate it 
when I'm around you. When it was 
just me and the cult, acting for Freeman, 
killing, spying, it feels right. It's 
why I stopped visiting you. Because you 
made me feel terrible about myself and 
the things that I've done."

Neither he nor Erika had the appetite for 
food, now. Erika called over the waitress, 
paid, and packed up the food.
