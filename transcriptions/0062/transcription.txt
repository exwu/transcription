"Thank you. If you'll leave it by the door, I will grab it momentarily."

"Nuh uh," he said. "This soup is very tipsy, see. Got to hand it off, hand to hand. Otherwise, who knows what might happened."

He repeated the wriggling motion. The implication was clear. 

"Okay, fine," Sebastian muttered to himself. He rolled off the bed, stopping to pick his clothes off the floor. 

"Oh no, don't get dressed on account of little old me."

Sebastian rolled his yes, went up to the bars. He heldo his hands out in front of him. 

"Nah, you've got to get closer, you need a good grip on it."

Sebastian stepped closer. At long last, the guard opened the slot but not without a blatant leer downwards. Sebastian swallowed nervously.
