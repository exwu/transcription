"I can explain," Sebastian gasped. 

"Explain what? 
It 
needs no explanation." Freeman 
grabbed at Sebastian's arm, pushing 
up the sleeve. It was the message Sebastian 
had shown him, blotchy with healing 
scabs. "You used that bloodied pen we found 
to gouge a false prophecy into your arm."

It was hideously obvious now. The 
words were unsteady and warped, the 
depth of the wounds varying wildly, 
some sections already healed, others 
still thick with scabs.

"Now get this waste of life out of my sight."

"Wait!" Sebastian struggled in vain as 
the guards attempted to lift him. "It's not 
what it looks like. I can explain."

Freeman ignored him, turning away.
