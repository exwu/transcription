[[ it floods the room, the sinners sink, the innocent rise... ]]

It was here, he realized, in his dream. It had broken free from his memory of the future, and it knew he was coming to it. 

"What have I gotten myself into?" 

Those were the words followed him on his lips when he awoke in the morning.
