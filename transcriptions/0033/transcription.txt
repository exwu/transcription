people doing their jobs, albeit in a 
cheaply constructed compound miles away 
from any where. 

There was no doubt now, though. 
Great expense had been taken 
to line the floors with dark 
stained wood. Banners of red cloth 
hung against the wall bearing an 
icon of a tree and its roots in 
the shape of an hour glass. The 
crowd kneeled before the stage in 
tidy practiced rows. Sebastian's guards 
took his crutches and lowered him 
to the ground before kneeling down 
beside him. They lowered their heads 
deferentially. 

Being in such a large 
group of people all silent was unnerving. 
Their heads were bowed, patiently 
waiting. Sebastian resisted the urge 
to do the same just to avoid standing 
out.
