There was no doubt now, though. Great expense had been taken to line the floors with dark stained wood. Banners of red cloth hung against the wall bearing na icon of a tree and its roots in the shape of an hour glass. The crowd kneeled before the stage in tidy practiced rows. Sebastian's guards took his crutches and lowered him to the ground before kneeling down beside him. They lowered their heads deferentially. 

Being in such a large group of people all silent was unnerving. Their heads were bowed ,patiently waiting. Sebastian resisted the urge to do the same just to avoid standing out.
