"No. The silence is fine."

Erika was dreaming true dreams.

It had taken some time to get used to, after the wild mosaics of the dreamers around her. She used to wake up, disoriented, unsure whether she had woken from from dream or vision. 

These days though, she could tell without difficulty. She was dreaming now. 

She was in their old cabin in the woods. In her dreams, she could still hear the distant voices of stranger's minds, though the memories were fast fading from her waking mind. The townspeople dreamt in the distance, fought, made love. Nearer by, Jared pondered the flash of connection that had wiped him from his own mind, and when it restored him, left him with memories of Sebastian's final moments. 

She would be alone in her dreams tonight, it seemed.
