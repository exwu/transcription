Her thoughts were clear and crystaline in their sharpness, and she could push them from her mind and enjoy the quiet sounds of the forest and the night that she could so rarely enjoy before. This moment of calm, this moment of grief was indisputably her own. 

There was a sound of a car's engine a long ways off, but coming closer. Erika set off along the road to meet it.

Erika recognized him.

"Who are you? How do you know who I am?"

"You were a friend of Sebastian's. I was, as well."
