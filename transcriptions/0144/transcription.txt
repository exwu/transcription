"I think i've paid enough already. It's 
probably time to start reaping the rewards."

Sebastian woke to a rattling knock. 
As he rubbed the sleep from his eyes, 
they entered his cell and began the 
process of photographing his wounds and changing his bandages---
these days a task which took nearly 
an hour. 

Sebastian was in the habit of staring 
blankly in the wall during the process, 
trying to pass through the block of time with 
as little presence as possible. Today, though, 
he couldn't help over hearing them complain 
that all this was a waste of time---
they'd be doing 
it all over again this afternoon
