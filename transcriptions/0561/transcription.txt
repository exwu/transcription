Never before had she heard such 
pure and absolute silence. 

"Sebastian?" she whispered, [[afraid]].

"I am here," said a voice, quiet.

Erika spun around, unaccustomed to 
being startled. 

"Sebastian, I---"

It wasn't him. Instead, there was a 
silhouette of golden script [[hunched over, as if fighting not to be crushed flat into the ground]], words swimming 
on its surface like oil on water. 
Its glow was indistinct, like a shadow 
of light. Erika looked carefully across its 
featureless face. 

"Sebastian, is that you?" 

"It is," he said. His voice was distant, 
as though he were speaking from somewhere 
far away. But, unmistakeably, it was his. 

"What...what happened? I was in the 
world tree---I thought I heard your voice."

"You became part of the world tree," he 
said. "But I 
pulled you back out, and each piece I 
took, I cut free from 
fate, from the world tree. You are free now."

"Is that what this silence is?" her own 
voice sounded unbearably loud in her ears. "It's 
so quiet now."

The silhouette nodded.
