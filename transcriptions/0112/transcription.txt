A woman's voice. Somehow he knew it 
was Bertholt's. 

Suddenly a sharp pain in his chest 
pulled his awareness, drifting 
among the many members of the field, 
suddenly back to his body and the heart 
above it. Gently, it pulled at a piece 
at him. Tenderly, it offered a piece 
of itself. 

At once he reached out to accept 
it, at once a boil of rage refused 
it. Another shock of pain rolled through 
him, defining arms, legs, chest 
against the advance of the heart. 

Sebastian came to his senses. 
This was the moment which would 
allow Freeman influence over him. 
Pain rolled through him like 
a trapped wave. He stopped trying to 
push through it and let it roll through 
him unencumbered. 

The heart quailed. It had no defense 
to such animal agony. Hastily, it withdrew 
its tendrils, offer rescinded. 

In his hands, the roots of the heart 
withered and turned to ash.
