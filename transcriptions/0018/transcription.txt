Then, suddenly, it was silent. Sebastian fell to his knees, aching on every inc of his body. He heaved for breath, trying to hear any signs of pursuers of the thundering of his heart. But there was nothing. Sebastian caught his breath. He stood. 

It was hard to say exactly how far he'd run. But hopefully it was far enough and the disorientation of the cornfields would do the rest. 

In terms of escape plans, this wasn't the best. The handcuffs were a problem, and so were the bare feet. In earlier years, the fresh woulds would have been a good excuse to delay any grabs for freedom, but Sebastian had been a prisoner for long enough to have run out of patience for another opportunity. 

All this was workable, he thought. He just had to get to a phone, and then...

The wind sent a wave of rustles through the corn field. Sebastian looked back in the direction he had run. He wondered if he could smell blood on the wind or if it was only his imagination.
