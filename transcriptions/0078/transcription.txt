After a few days the novelty of being out 
of his cell had begun to wear thin. 
Lectures on cult history and exercises 
in expanding one's mind 
could only hold his interest for so long, 
though Sebastian made sure to keep an 
appearance of studiousness.

No ideas were forthcoming about how 
to avoid whatever it was that 
Erika had warned him about. It hung 
over his mind like a dark cloud. 

Their shepherds had given them a 
moment of down time, which they 
could choose to spend on either 
meditation or study. The majority 
of their group had gone to the 
courtyard to meditate, leaving Michelle 
and Sebastian alone in the cult 
library.

Library in name only, Sebastian was 
disappointed to find. There were books 
in abundance but they were all copies 
of the same volume Sasha had given 
him earlier. With nothing better to 
do, Sebastian flipped through, 
reading passages at random.
