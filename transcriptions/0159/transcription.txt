"The Foundation bastards again?"

The man in the passenger's seat 
muttered to the driver. 

"Yeah," she responded. "Their 
place out in the desert. Remember last time we 
were there?"

"Yeah. We got shot to shit."

The driver took her eyes off the 
road for a moment, meeting 
Sebastian's in the mirror. "This time 
it's supposed to be different."

[[this should be in reference to them essentially trading him for information about the tree ]] 

Sebastian didn't respond. He looked 
away to the landscape passing outside. 
The feeling of deja vu hadn't 
fully left from the morning, though 
it was hard to say whether it just 
from being out in the cornfields or 
from the memories of his dreams.

(( though I never established how S. knew 
his dreams were true. Maybe need an 
episode about that? ))

Beside him Erika slept like the dead. 
Nervous energy and excitement
