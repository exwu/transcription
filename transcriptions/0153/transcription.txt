doing that already, subverting your sense 
of self for his benefit."

Erika's expression didn't change. 
"I can tell you're planning something. 
All that about serving the temple was 
a lie." 

"Have you told Freeman yet?" he asked. 

"No."

"Why not?" 

Sebastian smiled humorlessly as Erika 
failed to give an answer. She scowled.

"You know exactly why not."

"We can't all be mind readers, Erika. 
You sold me out at the initiation. 
Why not do it again?"

"Because Freeman's 
not here this time," she said, quietly. 

[[ do you want in? ]]

"He's not here now either," he said. 
"Just so you know, I do have a plan. 
But I don't intend to tell you." 

[[ Feel free to tell Freeman. But this time do it sooner than later, so I don't get my hopes up. ]]
