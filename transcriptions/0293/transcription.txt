An exchange of gunfire assaulted Sebastian's 
eardrums. Bullets tore through the hall's 
great tapestries where Erika had been 
only moments before, but there she 
gone. [[ there she gone. seriously. ]]

An uneasy stillness settled on the room. 
Freeman's men pointed their weapons into 
the darkness, scanning the shadows 
for any movement. [[ when I change this to be flood related, there's a thunderstorm ongoing. extra drama ]]. Just as they began 
to fan out to search, something 
clattered into the center of the stage. 
Sebastian looked over and 
immediately realized his mistake. 

The explosion 
from the flash grenade was enough to 
knock him off his feet. 
He groped blindly 
on the floor as his 
ears rang. As his vision cleared, 
he found himself face to face with 
a dead man, mouth agape at the 
sky. [[staring at him accusingly?]]
