of it. 

Sebastian retreated from the tree. He drifted down to its trunks [[localizing, temporily anchoring himself becomes harder]]where Erika's body still kneeled against it. He let what he had gathered flow from him back into her body. 

He felt her eyelids flicker beneath their lids. 

Ther was still more of her, dispersed far and wide through the world tree, across the world. But the task did not daunt him---he would bring it back.

Erika opened her eyes. The boughs of the world tree were above her. It was a sight she thought she would never see again. 

She started up. Where was Sebastian? Her thoughts were in disarray---he had come to find her, they had spoken---she turned to her side, where she had left him, but there was no one there. Only scraps of bandages, fading to ash. 

"Sebastian?" she called out into the cavern. But there was only silence in response. 

Silence. No singing from the world tree. No voices from nearby minds. [[ No stray thoughts, no intruding feelings. ]]
