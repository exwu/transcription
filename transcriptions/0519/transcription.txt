he had learned that this particular incarnation 
of the world tree was said to maintain 
the balance of all living things on 
Earth. Local lore spoke of the leafless 
tree blooming in the advent of calamity 
and leaving fruit as old life died and new took 
its place. Tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, 
floods world wide had brought 
fruit to the ancient tree's boughs. 
Previous hypotheses had assumed it to 
be some guardian entity, but in light 
of the test run on Erika and the 
Heart of the Monoculture, it seemed 
more likely that it was instead 
only a physical manifestation of the 
world's ecosystem as a whole. 
They had not yet managed to confirm the 
superluminal communication between 
tree and ecosystem, but 
if there was a chance, said Dr. Alto, after all this, 
they would run tests at first opportunity.
