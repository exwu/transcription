the same."

"You would think, but then why would someone like Dr. _____ stay? She's got opportunities everywhere. She doesn't need to be here. Same for the other 1000 people in this place. Freeman's guards are more for his collection than his flock."

"Would it be so bad, wanting to stay here?" Sebastian asked, in a low voice. "If I'm stuck here anyways."

"No!" Erika grabbed at the bars. Sebastian jumped back. "Dpn't follow that man. Give up on esaping, joing the cult, but don't let that man into your head. His thoughts are... insidious. Vile." Erika's hands were shaking on the bars. "Don't believe in him."

"Erika," Sebastian said softly. She looked up, surprised. But he didn't know what to say to her.

"I've done what I can," said Erika. "You know what's coming. I don't know how else to help you."
