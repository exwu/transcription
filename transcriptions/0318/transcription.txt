After three days of driving, they reached 
the coast. It was early down when 
they came across the sea, gray and 
endless. Sebastian pulled them into a 
nearby rest stop, parked the car, and 
sat down on the grassy hill to watch 
the waves crash beneath him. Erika 
joined him moments later. 

She handed him his coat, shrugging on 
her own before sitting down beside him.

"So we've run as far as we can," Sebastian 
said. The wind ran coldly through his clothes 
and hair, but it didn't seem to bother him. 

"In one direction. There's always 
north or south, even across the sea."

Sebastian looked out across the 
water, to where horizon blurred sea 
and sky. 

"Part of me feels like I'll never 
run far enough. That the cult 
will be coming for us, no matter where 
we go. We'll spend months and months 
running from them, and they'll find us 
again."
