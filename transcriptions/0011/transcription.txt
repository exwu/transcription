hastily dumped onto the asphalt while 
others went to fish out first aid kits. 

The other two vans pulled up behind 
them as someone pressed a bandage 
into Sebastian's neck. 

"What's going on?" The driver of the 
other van demanded hopping out. 

"He just started bleeding out of no 
where!" said the man with a hand on 
Sebastian's back. As the driver's skeptical 
look, "swear by 
the master's good name, we didn't touch 
him." 

The other members of the van 
murmured repeats of the oath. 

"Just get it cleaned up and let's get 
back on the road. We're nearly there."

The driver made to go back into his 
van, but the back slid open. The 
woman, Erika, stepped out. 

"There's trouble," she said. She 
threw the van driver a pair of binoculars. 
He looked down the road into the 
distance. 

Sebastian did the same. All he could 
see was the suggestion of a shimmmer 
of heat, some black specks on the horizon.
