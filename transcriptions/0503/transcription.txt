"Usually things don't go quite that 
wrong."

Sebastian returned to reading. 

"Dr. Bertholt hypothesized that the 
violation of relativity could only occur 
if the two entities in communication 
were not in actuality separate 
entities---simply two manifestations
of the same phenomena. In the case of 
E-1447 the instantaneous response of 
the root system to changes in the 
field as a whole was a consequence 
of cornfield and roots being a mutual manifestation 
of the monoculture. Extrapolating from 
this hypothesis, we can only assume that 
H-793 is a manifestation of the thoughts 
and emotions around it. Thus 
incident 793-K 
must be a consequence of H-793 
becoming capable of its own thoughts and 
emotions." [[and override that which she was only meant to represent ]]

"They found another one like them," 
said Jared. "H-793 and E-1447. ]]
