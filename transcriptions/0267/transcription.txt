it will all make sense. Could you 
relay that message for me?'

"I can let him know what you said," 
Sasha said. 

"Thank you," said Sebastian.

Sebastian called out to Sasha just as 
he was about to leave. 

"Sasha, I--- Thank you," he said. 
"Genuinely. For your kindness and your 
concern. It meant a lot to me."

"You're welcome, Sebastian," he said, 
uncertainly. 

"Before you go---the scales that 
Freeman took. Did you see what was 
engraved on the center piece?"

Sasha thought about it. "It was an angel, 
wasn't it? Why do you ask?"

"No reason," said Sebastian. "It's not 
important."
