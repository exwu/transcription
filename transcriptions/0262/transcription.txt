torn open and Sebastian was forcefully 
pulled out. 

Freeman snatched the bag from 
his hands. He unzipped it, pulling 
out the statuette. 

Though it was a statuette no longer. 
From the woman's shoulder blades sprouted 
a lever arm on a pivot. From there 
hung two plates on a delicate chain. 
These extra additions were composed 
of gossamer gold, as if it had been 
pulled from the air itself. 

"This is the artifact?" he said, 
turning it over in his hands. Freeman's 
guards held Sebastian in a kneeling 
position on the ground. "This useless 
trinket is what cost us four beloved lives? 
I'm surprised you came back 
after your little trick."

"What are you talking about? Sebastian 
tried to fight off the guards holding him 
down, failing miserably. 

"We searched your cell, after you had left," 
he sneered. "Do you know what we found? 
Let me give you a hint---it was squirreled 
away in the frame of your bed."
