Erika sat down behind him and began to unwind his bandages, exposing patches of skin to the cold. He shivered involuntarily, but she was quick to rebandage what she had undone. Her hands were warm on his back.

"Anywhere else?" she asked as he redressed. 

"No," he said. "What about you? I thought I saw you limped earlier."

"Just a scrape," she said. "I can take care of it later."

Sebastian shook his head. "No, let me. Give me your gloves."

"It's fine---!" she protested, but Sebastian reached out and grabbed her gloved hand. She froze, looked up at him confused. 

Careful not to touch her skin, he slid the gloves from her fingers. She didn't resist and let him pull them over his own hands.

He knelt down in front of her. She watched him fold up the leg of her pants, all to aware of the brush of his gloved fingers against skin.
