and nothing."

"Nobody and nothing was who I used 
to be. I am myself now. That's all I 
need."

The dreamwalker bowed his head 
in deference, and stepped backwards 
out of the dream.

Erika could feel herself pulling from 
the dream as well. She looked 
out to the great promontory of 
clouds. It seemed unreachably far 
away, though she knew the world 
tree [[was never]] more than a few days journey 
in the waking world. Some days 
it took all of her will power to 
not throw everything away 
and go to it, to its unearthly song 
and to Sebastian. But other days it 
barely crossed her mind. Slowly but surely, 
the stretches were the world tree barely interfered 
in her thoughts, and it was this she remembered in 
moments of weakness, and the pure contentment of the days she 
had spent with Sebastian. One day, if 
she lived long enough, she would find it again. 
She would have faith in Sebastian's choice.
