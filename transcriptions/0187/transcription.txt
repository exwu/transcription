artist from Marblehead. All those who 
viewed it came away with tears in their 
eyes, fell into a stupor of contemplation 
for the next several days regardless of 
their wealth or walk of life. I flew out

"It was being shown in a small 
gallery, in a small town. But artistic 
minds from around the world crowded 
into that tiny galleria. But despite 
the crowds, there was no murmur, 
no chatter, not even the flash of 
photography. Just a hundred people 
packed in solemn meditation. The 
sculpture, I could not describe it. A 
human form, grappling with the tides of 
time, entangled in its dual nature 
of beast and intellect. All of these things 
conveyed in silent marble." Simons 
closed his 
eyes. "Still, to this day, it haunts 
my dreams."
