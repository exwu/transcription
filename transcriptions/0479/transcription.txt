"Do we know where she's going?"

"We have theories," said Dr. Alto. 
"But among us, someone may know 
with some more certainty."

The table turned to look to Sebastian. 
"The world tree," he said quietly. 

"It's hard to say what will happen 
when she arrives. However, in the

over her, we did get some 
insight, thanks to Dr. Weaver."

Baers replaced the security footage 
with a set of graphs of peaks 
and spikes. It was meaningless to 
Sebastian ((maybe they actually didn't know))

"They were only testing for maximum 
range of affect, but Dr. Weaver had 
the insight to secure use of an atomic 
caliber clock. Assuming no operator or 
mechanical error, these results show 
that transmission is instantaneous---
violating the principal of locality---
the speed of light," he clarified 
for Jared + Sebastian.
