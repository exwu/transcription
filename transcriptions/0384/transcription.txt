of how old you are? How old are you 
anyways?

"Twenty two. Maybe twenty three 
at this point."

"Really? I thought for sure you were 
older than me."

"I'll take that as a compliment, I 
think?'

"Well, mine is March 11th. You can 
borrow mine, if you'd like."

Erika stared striaght ahead, 
seeing nothing in the dark. But Sebastian 
imagined even in this tiny town 
the night was very loud to her.

"Well, then, Sebastian. Where would 
you like to spend your birthday?'

Sebastian looked down at his hands. 
They looked 
strange and brittle in the flourescent 
glow of the streetlamps, and though 
he was sheltered from the elements 
in their car, there was a shiver 
he couldn't seem to shake off. 

"Home," he said. "I want to go home."
