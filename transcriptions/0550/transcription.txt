her head into the back of the world tree, 
and was gone.

((The End. Haha. ))

Sebastian felt her go, and was 
left limp and alone. Tears 
fell from his eyes. Never before had he felt so 
painfully alone. 

The mist grew thick. The branches of 
the world tree shivered, as if blown by 
a gale. Agony rippled across his skin 
as new prophecies of the new era of 
mankind overwrote the old. He had 
not stopped her. It would begin soon. 

[[ he might want her to die; he realizes that this is Erika + fate pushing him to feel this way ]]

He saw now that it was his own tangle 
of choices that had brought him here to 
this day. He had fought so hard to escape 
the fate that had been prescribed to him, 
though each step had only 
ever taken him closer to it. 
But in the end, 
he had still won. It was 
proof that despite the burden of fate, his 
choices were still his own. 

[[ He has another self, after the moment of transformation, that wants him to let Erika die, to kill her, to save himself. They disagree---is it even a meaningful disagreement? Are they really even the same people? Does he meaningfully move through time any more? ]]

[[ It's just a reflection of the reality of the dual truth; He at once regrets his choice and believes it was right, but his regrets are sent to the past, his hopes to the future ]]

The victory was hollow though. He hadn't 
killed her, but she was still gone 
forever from his reach.
