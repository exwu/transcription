"You shouldn't do this. Just step 
out now." 

"Why?" she whispered back. "How bad 
can it be?" 

"Do you even know what happened to them?" 
Sebastian said, nodding to those who 
had gone before. They seemed lost in 
contemplation, though those who had gone 
first seemed 
to have mostly returned to normal. 

"Some sort of psychoactive chemical, 
looks like," said Michelle. "Pretty 
standard for religious experiences. It looks 
pretty short acting, too." 

Sebastian shook his head. "It's not. It's 
something more than that. It changes your[[you]], 
irreparably. It cements your allegience 
to the cult."

"What are you talking about? It's just 
some sort of drug."

"It's not!" Sebastian hissed. 

"It must be. The stuff you're saying doesn't 
even make sense. It's impossible."
