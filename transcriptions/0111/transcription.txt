the corn, its pollen in the wind, even its symbiotes and parasites, the great system of life tied together at a heart no larger than a human fist. 

The humans, too, were part of it---harvesting, fertilizing, resowing. Strange keepers and reapers of life. There was a hunger here, for something like understanding but not quite. More like a greed, to spread, to expand, [[ to reach into fertile substrate ]] to  incorporate this external part of its ecosystem that not even the glut of lives the cult had offered could satiate. [[ The cult should have done something to give the corn a mind of its own. ]]

For each human that the Temple brought to commune with it took only a small part of it with them and left only a small part in return. 

But the heart of the endless fields knew all about small things and how, in fertile soil, they would grow. 

Understanding is necessarily an exercise in sacrifice. When we learn more of others we submit some of ourselves.
