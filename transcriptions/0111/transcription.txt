the corn, its pollen in the wind, even its symbiotes and parasites, the great system of life tied together at a heart no larger than a human fist. 

The humans, too, were part of it---harvesting, fertilizing, resowing. Strange keepers and reapers of life. There was a hunger here, for something like understanding but not quite. More like a greed, to spread, to expand, [[ to reach into fertile substrate ]] to  incorporate this external part of its ecosystem that not even the glut of lives the cult had offered could satiate. [[ The cult should have done something to give the corn a mind of its own. ]]
