"There are many things that seem 
impossible. This is only one of them."

Melissa looked at him as if he were 
crazy. 

"It's true!" he said to her. "I'm one 
of them."

He pulled back the arms of his robes. 
The wounds from the previous night 
were there, ugly and red. She looked at 
him in horror. 

"Who did that to you?" 

"No one. They happen on their own."

She still didn't believe him. Sebastian 
fought the urge to pull at his hair. 

"Don't go, Michelle. It's not worth it."

"Michelle Bantwin." It was Freeman. 
He stood by the machine. "There is not a problem?"

Freeman spoke to Michelle but his 
eyes were on Sebastian. Sebastian 
realized that before today 
he might not have known he was being 
initiated. 

"No, Master Freeman," she said, 
voice quavering slightly. She turned 
away from Sebastian and went into 
the clearing.
