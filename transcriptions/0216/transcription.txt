quickly growing darker as it soaked 
blood from the wound at his neck.

"Are you okay?" Erika whispered.

"Yeah. Just as usual."

"What does it say?"

Sebastian quickly glanced 
at the skin under his collar. "Can't tell," 
he said. "I'll have to wash it out later."

Erika nodded, and let them fall into 
silence. 

Simons tried to drag his feet, but 
Erika kept him to a swift pace, 
encouraging him with the barrel 
of her rifle when he faltered. Sebastian 
followed mechanically behind. Quickly 
Simon's gun began to grow heavy in his 
arms. Small sounds in the 
distance made his heart leap erratically 
from beat to beat. 

A clatter of gunfire split the 
silence. Sebastian's heartbeat began to thunder 
in his ears. The world seemed to 
narrow in focus to the gun, 
Simon's back.
