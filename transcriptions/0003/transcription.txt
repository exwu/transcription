The men of the van hopped out,
 eager to stretch their legs. 

"Why are we stopping here again? 
I thought the plan was to take him 
straight back to base."

"Fool Ed got himself burned up by 
our own grenade. They want to 
treat him before it goes bad. We'll 
be here at most until morning."

"What about him?"

"We'll take him with us. They've 
got cells in there."

"Hey, you."

He lifted his head to show he 
was listening. 

"You need a piss?" 

He nodded. 

They unstrapped him from his seat
and pulled him to his feet outside 
the vehicle. 

"It's good that he's so quiet, eh? 
The last one was all pleading and blubbering. 
Makes you feel terrible."

"I'll take blubbering any day 
over the cackling and muttering that
other one did. Remember him? All gray 
and stringy?"
