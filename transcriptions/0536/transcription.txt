said Sebastian with half-hearted humor. 
"And the world is being destroyed 
anyways, isn't it? It hardly matters 
now." 

"Do you really think you can stop her?"

Sebastian shook his head. "No, but 
even it's just to die beside her, I have 
to be there. If I can't do anymore 
than that..."

Jared pulled his gun out of his 
holster. "Here. 
This is yours. They pulled 
it off you when when we took you in. Heaven 
knows why I brought it with me."

It was Erika's gun. Sebastian 
accepted it. 

"Thank you. She left it with me 
with a promise. Doubtless you 
could tell."

"Hey, auguring is your job. I just 
look after you. Make good on that 
promise, kid."

[[ I forgot, Jared was assigned to Sebastian. ]]
