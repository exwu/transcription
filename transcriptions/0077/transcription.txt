"Thank you," Sebastian said. "I thought 
you'd forgotten about me."

"No," she said. "Not really. The 
guards barracks are next door. I can 
feel you from there."

Sebastian wanted to ask why she had 
stopped visiting, if 
he should apologize for 
something he had said. But he decided 
against it. Some other time, he thought, 
if Erika would let him. 

[[ maybe too far into Sebastian's head. ]]

"It's good to know you're 
looking out for me. I'll try to to do good 
by that."

"Yeah. Good luck with the recruitment 
process. I'll see you later. Before the 
end."

"I'll try not to be too brainwashed 
by then," Sebastian said. 

Erika smiled weakly at him. She 
pushed herself back upright, looking 
unsteadier than she had come in. 
Quickly, she composed herself. 

She, too, hesitated, before locking 
the door behind her.
