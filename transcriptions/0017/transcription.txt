Just as Sebastian was about to climb over the bank of the trench, Erika spun around to see him clamber out away from them. But before she could say anything, the man next to her collapsed with a ringing bang, dead. 

Like shadows, their enemies were emerging from between the stalks of corn. Sebastian didn't stick around to see the inevitable carnage. He disappeared into the field behind them. 

He ran through the cornfields, barely noticing as the thick leaves struck at his face and shoulders. He stumbled, bare feet in the soft ground. He fell hard, unable to catch himself with hands cuffed. Agony raced through him as his open wounds stung against the mud, but he forced himself to his feet and began to run again. 

Behind him gunfire continued, cracking like thunderless lightning. Though exhaustian and pain caught up to him quickly, he refused to let his steps falter.
