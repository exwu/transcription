Erika waited at the front of the van while 
Sebastian put the food away and bandaged 
his newly cleaned wound. 

"A while ago, before we left the cult, 
you were going to tell me something," she 
said. 

"Oh," said Sebastian. It seemed like an 
age ago. "I was going to say that you 
couldn't stay at the cult. It looked 
like it was killing you."

"Yeah, I know," she said. "I won't lie. Some 
days I hope that it will."

They came to the cornfields late 
at night, much sooner than Sebastian 
expected. As they drew close to the 
compound, they stopped to switch 
drivers---since Sebastian was still 
technically a prisoner. 

They approached the walls with mixed 
feelings. Erika was returning to 
under Freeman's thumb, Sebastian to 
his cell. And there was the matter of their 
dangerous cargo, set to go off like a 
ticking bomb. 

"What are you looking forward to most," 
he asked, mostly ironically. 

((Erika--shower, climbing through the sand))

"Sleeping in a real bed," she said. 
"No question. What about you?"
