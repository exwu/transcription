of the root system decreased by approximately 
40%. There was no question that 
the death of the crops was the cause. 
Kent insisted on verifying. All 
experiments resulted in the same 
outcome. 

We have not yet discovered the 
mechanism of communcation between 
the heart and the fields. It is not 
impossible that the root system around 
it is eventually connected to the 
field's as a whole, though this is not 
typical for corn plants. But even if it 
was[[were]], there is no way any sort of 
chemical signal can be transmitted 
across such great distances so quickly. 
That leaves only electrical 
or radiation-based communication, but 
we have detected no such signals. 
I feel something beyond our current 
scientific understanding is at work, 
perhaps something beyond science itself. 
Kent thinks I am being ridiculous,
