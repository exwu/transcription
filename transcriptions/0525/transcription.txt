"Erika!" he called out to her, but she did not hear him. 

On his skin, whispered the prophecies. Each step she took towards its trunk dug new messages of calamity into his flesh. He did not need to look at them to know what they said. 

An end for this era, to the end of the dominion of thought. All hunger will end, all striving, all love---all will be washed free in the flood...

"Erika, you know what wil happen if you go! You can't!"

Erika's eyes were dark, glazed by thoughts that made her deaf to his words. Were they her own? The world tree's? Or someone else's entirely. 

The fruit of Yggdrasil returns to its parent and from it will bloom blood and light...

Erika's gun was in his pocket. 

"Erika, stop!" he said, holding the gun in his shaking hands. "I'll stop you if I have to."

He saw her eyes flicker towards him,
