is what I meant to say. Some of 
these should have been stiched up."

"Well, human menageries 
masquerading as psychiatric hospitals 
aren't exactly known for their standard 
of medical care. I used to care more 
about this sort of things[[typo]]---scars 
and disfigurement, but these days 
it doesn't seem important anymore."

Erika began to wrap the 
still bleeding wounds. With her 
careful, deliberate touch, Sebastian 
was reminded that she probably knew 
what he was feeling [[even]] if he 
didn't say it. 

"How long has this been going 
on for?"

"Five years now. It started 
my second year of university. Turns 
out my parents [[ aunt and uncle? ]] only had enough 
patience and money for two years of 
wild goose chases and puzzled doctors. 
[[ Do this thing where the way he talks about them changes through the story ]] 
When Bedlam was willing to take me 
in, they jumped at the chance. I 
haven't seen them since." 

 "You don't seem too upset about it."

"You mean, I'm not too upset about 
it," [[That must mean that I'm not too upset about it]] said Sebastian, smiling through 
the sudden pain as Erika pressed 
the gauze into the open wounds.
[[ she flinched and murmured an apology ]]
