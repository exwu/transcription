Sebastian jumped, startled [[redudant much]]. Simons had snuck up on him, alone in the room. Quickly, he realized that he had not heard his and Irene's voices for some minutes. He spun around, looking for her.

She was there, in the distance, negotiating coffee with one of Simon's staff. 

"Charming woman, isn't she, your aunt? But a bit of a talker. But I've already heard all her kind has to say I'd much rather know what's happening in your mind."

"I'm just admiring your collection," Sebastian said cautiously. "It's very...eclectic."
