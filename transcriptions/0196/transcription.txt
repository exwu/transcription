tales of his collection. Sebastian tagged 
along, at once imp-
ressed and overwhelmed. 

He was supposed to be scouting 
as well, to reconcile reality 
with his dreams. No doubt that this 
was the right gallery---the walls and 
floors, the emptiness and light---
were intensely familiar. But its 
contents, sculptures and historical artifacts 
and strange machines, were bewildering 
and surprising. In his dreams, the halls 
were [[had been]] empty.

As Irene let Simon lead her through 
the gallery, Sebastian passed bone flutes 
rich with carvings, scepters and 
crowns caked with jewels 
glittering with unearthly light. 
One room was filled with ramshackled 
machines composed of scrapwood and 
garbage that nonetheless ran 
merrily on, delighting in their own 
creaking [[croaking?]] sounds.
