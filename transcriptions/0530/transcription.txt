more."

The dreamwalker took another step 
back, tugging at Sebastian's hands to 
do the same. Sebastian's grip tightened 
as he put his foot out over the open air. 
He shut his eyes and tried not to think 
of the dizzying height. 

"No, not like that. You must acknowledge 
the distance, not shut it out."

Sebastian forced his eyes open. Though 
he knew it wasn't here, the 
calm of Erika's expression gave him 
peace. He stepped out over the ledge. 

He was standing now, floating 
over the winds and clouds that surrounded 
the outcropping. 

The dreamwalker smiled. "Nicely done. 
Now come with me."

The dreamwalker led him out into 
the open air. He followed on unsteady 
steps, growing steadier as he saw that 
he wouldn't plunge the ground. 

"If you can overrule the whims 
of gravity, do you not think it's odd that 
you can't even budge 
two stone doors? Let me show you why."

The dreamwalker stepped behind 
the stone gate. 

Hesitantly, Sebastian followed. 

There was nothing behind the door.
