to plan."

Freeman stepped back from the bars
to consider. Beside him, Sasha stood still, 
fixated on the knotted scars on his chest. 

"I'm willing to entertain your proposal. 
But despite your words, the 
scales seem inert."

"They aren't ready yet," Sebastian said. 
"It requires three days of rest. The first 
it produces the crossbar. The second the 
chains and plate. On the thirds, the feather. 
Only then it can be used."

"And how is it used?" Freeman asked. 

"Gather your men around it on the 
third day, as the feather is complete," 
said Sebastian. "That's all that's needed."

Freeman tugged at his chin. "So 
we still have another day before we can 
test this scale of yours. But in the 
meanwhile there are other things we can 
test."

Sebastian felt a chill tighten on his 
heart. "What do you mean?"
