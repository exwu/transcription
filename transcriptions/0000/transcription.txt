Through the haze of his dream 
he heard gunshots. Half awake, 
half asleep, he grimaced. Already 
the dream was fading. He tried 
to force himself to return to it, 
but there was little left---just a 
reaching, striving, the sensation of 
wind across his skin. There was 
nothing left of his dream except 
his failure to hold onto it. He 
opened his eyes. He was awake 
now.

The guards of his cell were gone. Probably 
to attend to whatever crisis was at hand. 
Gingerly, he raised his arms to stretch. 
The movement loosened the bandages 
around his arms and chest and they 
drooped, catching on his hips or falling 
to the floor. Underneath were fresh 
wounds, no longer bleeding but still 
red and angry with blood. The movement 
sent stings of pain throughout his body, 
as the wounds reopened and began to bleed 
[[in]] and fits and starts. 

The gunshots continued, now joined 
by the boom of explosives. He imagined 
that he could hear the sounds of 
footsteps in the walls around him.
