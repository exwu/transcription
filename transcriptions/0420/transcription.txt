night was quiet, with the hushed quality 
that brought on only by the falling snow. 
Sebastian was awake as well, morose, 
drunk.

He sat 
by the window sill, letting the cold 
of the glass and the winter beyond 
seep through his clothes and onto 
his back. He had worked his way 
through two of their leftover beers, 
and was onto his third.

"Bad dreams?" she asked, walking 
over to sit by him.

"Yeah," he said. "You know, you've 
asked that question before."

"I have?"

"When we first met. The night they 
took me from Bedlam."

"I remember now," 
she said. "Your 
dreams were keeping me awake. It's 
hard to fall asleep when next to you someone's 
convinced they're going to die."

"Do you still have trouble sleeping?" Sebastian 
asked.

"Not as much anymore," she said.
