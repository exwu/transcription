"Yeah, it's uh, no problem. Just don't hold it against me tomorrow."

"You know, I've said it before, but you're like a completely different person sometimes."

"You caught me in a good mood," she said. "Since Freeman's not around." She climbed back into bed. "Now get in bed and go to sleep. I won't be able to fall asleep with you standing there fretting about impropriety or something British like that."
