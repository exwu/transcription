ago. Now there was only the 
mountains, the trees. What wildlife, 
if any, were silent. 

The road grew muddy and 
poorly kept. A twist in the road 
combined with a gnarled tree root 
sent the truck careening off 
the side of the road. Sebastian 
pulled food, water, and fresh 
bandages from the truck and 
abandoned it there, walking 
the rest of the way. 

A warm mist twisted among 
the trees, clinging to Sebastian's 
skin and mingling with his sweat. 
It seemed to thicken the air and 
swallow all sounds. There was no 
sign of the sun above him. Often, 
Sebastian wondered if he was lost, 
but there was only one road into 
the heart of the forest, and it led 
to the world tree.

Thirst haunted him, 
then hunger, so he ate and drank. 
He had sweat through his bandages 
and they grew damp and itchy, so 
he changed them. [[ odd that he can walk despite pretty much dying, no? ]] New 
cuts stretched across his thighs 
and chest, murmurs of the new 
age of unified heart and mind.
