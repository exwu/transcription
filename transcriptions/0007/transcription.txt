He sat bolt upright in the cot, 
heart pounding, breathing hard. Slowly, 
as his eyes adjusted to the darkness, 
the concreteness of his surrounding 
slowed his breathing and heart. He 
pressed his hand to his thigh, where 
it had been struck in his dream. 
His hand came away wet with blood. 

Grimacing, he began to tear 
the blanket into strips to staunch 
the bleeding. Before bandaging 
the wound however, he could not help 
but read the message newly written 
in his flesh. 

"Enter the Black Daphne." 

Its meaning was nonsense to him. 
He quickly wound the bandages around 
his thigh and pulled it tight. It 
wouldn't hold up long, but it would 
work for now. 

Hobbling slight[[ly]], he got out of the 
cot and limped to the door. Now that 
the guards were likely to be asleep 
he tried the door. Locked of 
course. But maybe the window 
could be broken...

"Bad dreams?"
