"One thing is clear," the dreamwalker said. 
"Things are coming to an 
end soon for you. The dreams, the new 
prophecies, the new words---the arrival of the Deva 
birthright has already happened. All 
that[['s]] left is to embrace it."

"Is that why I've been feeling so weak 
lately?" 

"I imagine that your body is at war. 
Your physical self is incompatible with 
the transcendental nature of the Deva. 
At this point, things won't get better."

"I thought we would have more time," 
he said. "But I guess that's 
not true. I just feel like we didn't have 
enough."

Sebastian awoke to find [[ Erika asleep]] 
at the side of his bed, head 
crooked at an uncomfortable angle in her 
sleep. It was a welcome change of pace 
from his usual hospital awakenings.

She stirred and woke quickly after 
he did. There were dark bags beneath 
her eyes. She grimaced and straightened 
out the kinks in her neck.
