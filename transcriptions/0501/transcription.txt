"Upon re-entering H-793 was subjected to the following tests:
- salivary gland remote stimulation
- and so on so forth

See appendix I-83 for details.

Neural responses were recorded with nanosecond precision with an atomic clock. Synchronized clocks were also used to time both the source of the stiulus and H-793. The data gathered shows that stimulus and subject reaction occur simultaneously, even at distances greater than 400m. Effect is reproducible across mutliple sessions. Assuming no operator or machine error, this implies H-793's perceptions of other's emotional states
