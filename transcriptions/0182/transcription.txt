made it. If you need to rest, I have 
accommodations prepared."

"That's a kind offer, but 
the only thing 
keeping me together is 
anticipation of 
your wonderful gallery. 
I shall be crushed if we don't 
see at least a bit tonight."

Mikel smiled at the flattery. "Very 
well then. Let's get started right away. 
I'll have refreshments served to us while 
we are en route." 

Mikels stood from his seat, and with 
a grand gesture directed the to follow 
him. (( they were probably eating )). 
As he led them from the room, Sebastian 
and Irene exchanged a quick glance 
of relief. The rest of their team was 
scheduled to arrive in just over an hour. 
Ideally they should see as much of the 
facility as possible before then.
