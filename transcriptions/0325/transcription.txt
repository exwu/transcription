either. I thought you 
were happy to keep driving around forever."

Erika smiled, shaking her head. "I want 
what you want. I thought that was obvious."

Night had well and truly set in by 
the time they came to the end of the road. 
The cottage was a squat silhouette before 
the great shadows of the forest around 
them.

Erika tossed Sebastian the keys, and stood 
by his side as he unlocked the door. 
They used flashlights to inspect the inside. 
A fireplace, a cramped kitchen, 
shelves cramped with books and 
board games and linens. A couch, a 
bed. Huge windows overlooking 
the dark lake.

Sebastian wandered over to the windows, 
barely noticing as he stumbled over the 
cabin's uneven flooring and mismatched 
rugs. Above the lake, the stars glittered 
in a great stream above the still like. 

"The bed is all yours," said Erika. "I'll 
take the couch. In the morning we can 
see about the generator."

Sebastian didn't hear her, but she 
didn't mind. He was enrapt by the 
view of the stars, the lake, the forest.
