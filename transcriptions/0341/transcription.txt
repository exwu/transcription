of the good weather to restock.

She was a little disappointed that he wasn't around. She went down to the lake to wait for him to come back.

On the lakeside, she fished for stones to skip, though instead of skipping they skidding across its frozen surface. Erika dusted off a snow covered rock, sitting down to face the open lake.

Restlessness only let her enjoy the view for a moment. The urge to wander was strong, like an external force. But Erika was accustomed to sensations from outside of her own mind. She pushed the urges aside and forced herself to settle down. Uneasily, she drifted off to a half sleep. 

A strange thwack sound woke her, followed by a wave of disgust. Erika, disoriented, stood and stretched the kinks from her legs. It was just past noon. Sebastian was back, and not happy about something. 

She found him in the hunter's shed they had mostly ignored until now, arms deep in deer guts.
