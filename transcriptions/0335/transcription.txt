off, felt his presence from even farther. 

"If you want me to compliment your 
singing I can."

Erika cleared her throat. "I don't know 
what you're talking about. Also I don't 
always notice whether it's me or you
feeling the things I feel."

"I'm just kidding," said Sebastian. 
"It was nice, though. No need to 
be embarassed."

"Hm. Well, thank you," she said 
gruffly, returning her attention to 
the roof.

"How's the view from up there?" 
he asked. 

Erika paused, 
turning her face upward into the 
sunlight. 

"It's beautiful," she said. "Nothing 
but forest and mountains as far as the 
eye can see. I can hear the wind, the birds. 
Not a soul for miles around. Even if 
I try, I can't feel anyone around for 
miles." She leant back onto the warm 
roof. "It's such a relief, to be alone 
at last."

"Except for me," said Sebastian, but 
Erika didn't seem to hear him.
