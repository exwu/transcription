They decided to make a stop over in 
the village to pick up some 
supplies before heading back home.

(( They should know the Foundation 
is coming for them from S's))

Erika loaded up the car, letting Sebastian 
chat up the general store's owner 
while he paid. She 
couldn't decide 
whether he was in a good mood or 
not, as he laughed and joked with 
the shopkeeper. Her own chest 
felt heavy with resignation.

A note of surprise caught her attention 
from across the street. She looked up from 
their groceries just in time to see Mrs. 
Grady hurry into the village's 
only bar.

"That wasn't nearly as hard on the 
wallet as I thought," said Sebastian, 
struggling a little under the last load of 
their groceries. "Do you want to go 
spend the rest at the Gorge?"
