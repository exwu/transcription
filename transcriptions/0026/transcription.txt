Dark would shelves held musty tomes and strange artifacts from an assortment of cultures. Antique furniture was densely packed into the room, throwing strange shadows in the dim light. 

A man stood in the center of the room. HIs face was thin and neat. His hair was slicked back and his spine ramrod straight. HE wore red robes which hung straight from his shoulders to the floor. 

"Make him stand," he said to the guards. 

They uncuffed him and pulled him roughly from the chair. Sebastian sunk as his leg protested, but they grabbed him by the shoulder and kept him upright. 

Sebastian tried to meet the man's eyes as he stared him down, but his eyes barely glanced at Sebastian's face, going straight to the wads of guaze on his back, arms, and legs. He walked slowly around them. The hair on the back of his neck stood straight up as the man passed close behind him. 

Sebastian bit back a yelp as he tore teh bandage from the back of his neck off.
