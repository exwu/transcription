on an old hunting rifle Sebastian had 
leant against the box.

"Must have been a hunter," Sebastian 
said. "There's a bunch of dear skins 
and antlers in a shed in the back."

Erika picked it up, swung it open, 
looked down the sights. 

"Could come in useful," she said, 
and leant it against the wall.

Winter set in quickly after they 
arrived. After the first dusting of 
snow, Sebastian was glad they had 
managed to buy enough food to last 
them until the roads cleared, but 
as soon as they had, went back and 
properly stocked up on food and 
fuel. The townspeople were happy 
to provide wintering advice. Tire 
chains and canned goods consumed a 
good amount of money they had 
taken from the cult, but neither he 
nor Erika were concerned---they would 
address those problems when they got 
there.

Without much else to do, they 
worked through the laundry list
