"It probably wouldn't survive it" Sebastian 
admitted. "It's not exactly in great shape."

"You do occasionally seem embarrassed 
about it. Why don't you 
cut it, now that you're out of prison?"

"Oh. Because it's falling out."

"What?"

"You haven't noticed?" Sebastian said, 
smiling. "It's not like I'm going bald 
or anything. It just falls out, in 
clumps. It's less noticeable when it's 
long."

[[ that was a low moment, when I realized ]]

"There's nothing wrong with being bald," 
said Erika, though she didn't look any 
less alarmed. "I used to be bald."

"You were?"

"Well, they shaved all my hair off. Better 
contact for electrodes."

"Oh. That sounds pretty bad."

Erika knodded [[ nodded]]. "Being bald was pretty 
bad," she agreed.

"Is that why you keep your hair long?"

"I guess so," she said. 

"Do you ever take it out of a pony 
tail?" he asked.
