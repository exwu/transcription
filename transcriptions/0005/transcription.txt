He nodded. "Bathroom?" he asked. 
His voice was hoarse with disuse. 

"Higgs, you go with him. Then 
take him to the cell. It's in 
the far building."

A man with a face like a 
wall pushed him towards an 
outhouse some way from the main 
cluster of buildings. He at least 
gave him the dignity of privacy 
before towing him off towards his 
new cell. 

Less like a cell more like a 
closet with a cot. A window into 
the room allowed for observation. 
He hesitated momentarily at its door, 
but Higgs was happy to push him 
the rest of the way inside and lock 
the door behind him. 

He sat down on the cot and 
waited for night to come. 
When it arrived, he lay down and 
fell asleep.

Winds tore at his skin.
