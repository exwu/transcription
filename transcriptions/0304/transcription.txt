Waiting at the compound's exit was 
a van. There was no sign of the 
guards. Erika rolled down the window 
as Sebastian approached. 

"Ready to go?"

"I wasn't sure that you wouldn't leave 
without me."

Erika smiled wryly as Sebastian 
hopped in the passenger's side. "I had 
a feeling you would say that."

"Did you finish doing what you 
needed to?" Sebastian asked. 

"Yeah," said Erika, looking 
into the distance. "What about you? 
Did you kill it?"

Sebastian was thrown off by the 
question, forgetting that he 
didn't need to share his concerns 
with Erika for her to know them. 

"No," he said. "I thought about 
it, but in the end I just left the scales 
there. No one like Freeman should 
ever be able to use the heart like 
that again."
