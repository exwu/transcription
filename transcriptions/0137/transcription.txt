wisdom, but none of it about herself. It was very much like her. 

She is not dead, not yet. But I have told her children that she is one. To give them hope, when there would be too cruel. I allow myself hope, and it tears me apart. 

I found her in the chamber of the heart, where Marcus lay [[laid]]. Its roots had grown round her. They traced her skin like fine lace. Her eyes were shut. She was breathing. But she would not wake. Not when we brought her to the surface, doused her with water, injected her with adrenaline. An EKG revealed no brain activity. She was already gone. But I know where. 

I went to the heart, let it whisper to me. She was there, but not all of her. Mother and wife and sister was there. Even scientist. But the essense of her, her laughter, he intelligence, her kindness, was not. Where had it gone?
