wisdom, but none 
of it about herself. [[ but so sparingly about herself ]] It was very much 
like her. 

She is not dead, not yet. But I 
have told her children that she is gone. 
To give them hope, when there is none, 
would be too cruel. I allow myself [[this]] hope, 
and it tears me apart. 

I found her in the chamber of the 
heart, where Marcus lay [[laid]]. Its roots had 
grown round her. They traced her skin like 
fine lace. Her eyes were shut. She was 
breathing. But she would not wake. Not 
when we brought her to the surface, 
doused her with water, injected her with 
adrenaline. An EKG revealed no brain 
activity. She was already gone. But I know where. 

I went to the 
heart, let it whisper to me. 
She was there, but not all 
of her. Mother and wife and sister was there. 
Even scientist. But the essense of her, 
her laughter, he intelligence, 
her kindness, was not. Where had it 
gone?
