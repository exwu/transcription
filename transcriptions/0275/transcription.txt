up to worse, all the time," he said. Sebastian 
tried to push himself upward, but 
a twinge of pain collapsed his arm 
beneath him. Beside him, Erika flinched.

"I hate him, Sebastian. I hate that 
he did this to you. I hate what he's 
done to me." She buried her face in 
her hands. "I hate it." [[italized]] 

The word lingered in her throat, 
bordering almost on a scream. 
Her shoulders began to shake with her 
uneven breath. 

"Are you crying, Erika?"

She looked back up at him. 
He could see nothing of her face 
but a glimmer of wetness in the dark. 
She rubbed her fingers over her eyes and 
it disappeared. 

Sebastian was almost shocked. 
He 
struggled to find the worlds to say. 

"It'll be okay," he said. "It will 
all be okay."
