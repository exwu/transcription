door, Mick nursing a wound on his 
upper arm. Freddie was only steps 
away from the pedestal when 
they had died. All of the same cause: 
a gaping hole instead of a heart.

Sebastian stood in front of the 
pedestal. The glass was so thick with 
glass [[cracks]] that he couldn't see beyond it. 
Even so, he could feel its eyes on him, 
the winged, toothed thing of his dreams. 

Sebastian reached out and 
grabbed the glass. With a forceful 
twist he dislodged it from the 
pedestal, though it shattered in 
his hands, driving sharp edges into 
his fingers. Sebastian winced, but lifted 
the case from the pedestal nonetheless. 

It was a statuette. Elegant in its 
simplicity, it depicted a woman, in a 
dress of feathers, and a crown of feathers 
for hair. 

Sebastian dropped the glass case on the 
floor where it shattered.
