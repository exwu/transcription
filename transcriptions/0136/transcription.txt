When I stood there, in the fields---as the 
fields, I felt a peace like I had never 
before. I was surprised how natural it 
felt, like I had been with them all along. 
In a way, I have. We have lived here 
nearly a year now. My children have 
grown here. My husband is buried here. 
If only, before he had died, he had 
been able to see what I 
had seen---had given a part of himself to 
the heart, as I have. Then, he would 
be with us, still. Kent, though, I will 
have forever, and when Sasha + Maria 
are older, I perhaps they will choose to 
join us as well. Then though death may 
take us one by one, we shall never be 
apart.
