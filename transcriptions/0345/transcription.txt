you read," she said. "Catching snippets 
of thoughts---your and the characters.

back to his book, though he could barely 
see it He could feel her attention on 
him.

"Sebastian," she said after 
a moment.

"Yes?" he said, pretending to stop 
reading.

"Your bandages---did you change 
them while I was gone?"

"I did. Though maybe not as often 
as I should have. Why do you ask?"

"No reason," she said. "Do they 
need to be changed now?"

Sebastian thought about it. The 
marks on his back hadn't bothered him 
for a while, but that was no excuse 
to be lazy about it.

"Sure."

"Let me grab my gloves," Erika said, 
rising from the couch.

Sebastian stole her spot on the couch
. He pulled off his shirt, inspecting 
it for unexpected stains.
