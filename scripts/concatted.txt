Through the haze of his dream 
he heard gunshots. Half awake, 
half asleep, he grimaced. Already 
the dream was fading. He tried 
to force himself to return to it, 
but there was little left---just a 
reaching, striving, the sensation of 
wind across his skin. There was 
nothing left of his dream except 
his failure to hold onto it. He 
opened his eyes. He was awake 
now.

The guards of his cell were gone. Probably 
to attend to whatever crisis was at hand. 
Gingerly, he raised his arms to stretch. 
The movement loosened the bandages 
around his arms and chest and they 
drooped, catching on his hips or falling 
to the floor. Underneath were fresh 
wounds, no longer bleeding but still 
red and angry with blood. The movement 
sent stings of pain throughout his body, 
as the wounds reopened and began to bleed 
[[in]] and fits and starts. 

The gunshots continued, now joined 
by the boom of explosives. He imagined 
that he could hear the sounds of 
footsteps in the walls around him. 
There was little adornment in his 
cell of a room, yet a mirror had 
been prepared for him. He shook 
loose the remaining bandages as he 
approached it, inspecting the wounds 
beneath. 

They were shallow cuts, but long, 
in ragged lines across his chest. The 
cuts seemed violent in their raggedness, 
but their pattern was clear: they 
spelled a message.

His violent visitors now burst into 
the room as he touched the edge of the 
wound. As they prised open the cell 
and bundled him away, he could feel 
the letters burn into his skin. 

"The only true freedom is death." 

---

He kept a passing attention to what 
was happening around him. Blindfolded and cuffed, 
he was pushed through the halls, then 
outside, then to a vehicle. 

They spoke gruffly to him, barking 
one word orders he obeyed without question. 
If he were ever slow to respond, a gun 
would be pressed to his back to hurry
him along. After several hours in whatever 
vehicle, they began to speak 
more freely with each other. 

"Easy pickings, huh?"

"We should've taken more than just the kid."

"Nah, you saw what happened to Jeff. And that was just for pickin' up some stray cash."

They exchanged brief banter now and 
then over staticky music played over the 
radio. For 
the most part they ignored their 
prisoner, sitting silent and blindfolded 
in a back seat. He had long since 
since pieced together the number of 
men in the car, associated 
names with voices, and promptly forgot 
them. As they drove through the night, 
he felt himself drift to and from 
sleep, waiting for them to feel the 
need to remove his cuffs and blindfold. 

Some hours later, the vehicle stopped. 
The men of the van hopped out,
 eager to stretch their legs. 

"Why are we stopping here again? 
I thought the plan was to take him 
straight back to base."

"Fool Ed got himself burned up by 
our own grenade. They want to 
treat him before it goes bad. We'll 
be here at most until morning."

"What about him?"

"We'll take him with us. They've 
got cells in there."

"Hey, you."

He lifted his head to show he 
was listening. 

"You need a piss?" 

He nodded. 

They unstrapped him from his seat
and pulled him to his feet outside 
the vehicle. 

"It's good that he's so quiet, eh? 
The last one was all pleading and blubbering. 
Makes you feel terrible."

"I'll take blubbering any day 
over the cackling and muttering that
other one did. Remember him? All gray 
and stringy?" 


"Ugh. Who could forget him. And that smell!"

They uncuffed him and pulled the bag 
from his eyes. 

It was a young man, no older than 
25 years. His hair was maybe blond, maybe 
white, his eyes were gray and dull. He shivered 
in the evening breeze---
they had stolen him from the hospital 
without a shirt, and he had only 
thin scrubs for pants. His only insulation 
from the cold were the bandages 
wrapped over his arms, chest, and legs. 

Captors and captured got their 
first careful 
look at each other. The men were 
all quite similar, rough in manner 
and build, wearing black fatigues 
with armor vests. The six of his van 
were making their way to a small 
complex of undecorated shacks, 
joined by those from the other two 
vans. 

"Now don't you try and run. Not 
that you'll get far in those socks 
and nothing else. Or we'll hog 
tie you up for the rest of the way."


He nodded. "Bathroom?" he asked. 
His voice was hoarse with disuse. 

"Higgs, you go with him. Then 
take him to the cell. It's in 
the far building."

A man with a face like a 
wall pushed him towards an 
outhouse some way from the main 
cluster of buildings. He at least 
gave him the dignity of privacy 
before towing him off towards his 
new cell. 

Less like a cell more like a 
closet with a cot. A window into 
the room allowed for observation. 
He hesitated momentarily at its door, 
but Higgs was happy to push him 
the rest of the way inside and lock 
the door behind him. 

He sat down on the cot and 
waited for night to come. 
When it arrived, he lay down and 
fell asleep. 

---

Winds tore at his skin. 
The skin of his feet tore 
as he fought to gain purchase at the 
ground. His skin tore as he struggled 
against the stone door, desperately 
trying to budge it. 
[[ apparently tore is the only word I know ]]

Any attempt to open his eyes against 
the wind immediately flooded them with 
stinging tears. The stone was cold 
and sent chills through his skin into 
his bones, making him feel brittle 
and weak. But he could not cease 
his struggle against the stone door. 
If he did...

A piercing pain attacked his thigh. 
Though he couldn't open his eyes to 
see it, he could feel the skin splitting, 
the muscle beneath to spasming at 
it was torn apart. His leg 
collapsed beneath him. He fell 
from the door. Desperately he 
scrabbled for some purchase 
to hold himself up with, but there was 
none. 

The pain was unbearable, he felt 
himself from consciousness [[lose?]]. But the 
door--

He sat bolt upright in the cot, 
heart pounding, breathing hard. Slowly, 
as his eyes adjusted to the darkness, 
the concreteness of his surrounding 
slowed his breathing and heart. He 
pressed his hand to his thigh, where 
it had been struck in his dream. 
His hand came away wet with blood. 

Grimacing, he began to tear 
the blanket into strips to staunch 
the bleeding. Before bandaging 
the wound however, he could not help 
but read the message newly written 
in his flesh. 

"Enter the Black Daphne." 

Its meaning was nonsense to him. 
He quickly wound the bandages around 
his thigh and pulled it tight. It 
wouldn't hold up long, but it would 
work for now. 

Hobbling slight[[ly]], he got out of the 
cot and limped to the door. Now that 
the guards were likely to be asleep 
he tried the door. Locked of 
course. But maybe the window 
could be broken...

"Bad dreams?" 
He started. There was someone there, 
at the window. One of the men from 
the vans, though this one was a woman. 
She wore the same uniform as the 
rest. In the darkness her hair 
was pitch black, pulled back 
into a small ponytail. Her eyes 
were not much more than shadows. 

"You could say that," he said 
warily, though his voice was weak, 
still out of breath from the exertion 
of the dream. "What do you want?" 

"Nothing. I was going to wake you 
up, but it seems you took care of 
that for me."

"Why?" he searched for some trace of 
anger in her eyes, but the dark 
obscured any intentions. Had she noticed him trying to escape? 

"I was having trouble sleeping, too,"
she said. "What's your name?"

The question caught him off guard. He 
answered truthfully. 

"Sebastian. Sebastian Warren," 
he said. He paused, then asked. 
"What's yours?" 

"Erika Matthews," she said. "It was
nice to meet you, Sebastian. Sleep well."

She left, disappearing down into the 
hall. 

Sebastian watched her go, 
not entirely certain he hadn't 
just woken up into another dream. 

---

The next morning, they recuffed him 
and brought him back into the van. 
This time at least they didn't 
feel a need to blindfold him. 

As they loaded up their vans again, 
Sebastian kept an eye out for the woman 
who had visited himself, not entirely 
convinced she was real. 

Just as they were about to 
pull back onto the highway, Sebastian 
caught a glimpse of her, head down, 
eyes closed in the back of the van. 

So the strange encounter had not been 
a dream then. Sebastian settled in to wait. 

---

The view from the window had long 
since lost any interest to him. Endless 
fields of corn had filled the view for the 
last several hours and had every appearance 
of going to continue for several hours more. 
The radio, too, had since fizzled 
away to static. His captors grew just as antsy and 
bored as he was. 

Sebastian shifted uncomfortably. The 
new wound on his leg began to itch and 
sting. He was still wearing his torn 
blanket bandages from the previous night. 
They had done a poor job of stopping the 
bleeding, but his captors had either 
not noticed or cared. 

The irritation built up slowly, spreading 
along avenues of newly healed cuts and old 
scars until every one of Sebastian's cuts 
seemed to burn beneath their bandages. 
He gripped hard at his knees as the 
sensation welled up at the top of his 
neck. 

"Hey, hey, there's something wrong with 
the kid." 

Blood began to well up at the newly 
opened wound at the top of his spine. The 
driver swore and radio'd the others 
to say they were pulling over. 

They pulled onto the side of the 
road. Someone's spare 
uniform was sacrificed to keep blood 
off the car seats. Sebastian was 
hastily dumped onto the asphalt while 
others went to fish out first aid kits. 

The other two vans pulled up behind 
them as someone pressed a bandage 
into Sebastian's neck. 

"What's going on?" The driver of the 
other van demanded hopping out. 

"He just started bleeding out of no 
where!" said the man with a hand on 
Sebastian's back. As the driver's skeptical 
look, "swear by 
the master's good name, we didn't touch 
him." 

The other members of the van 
murmured repeats of the oath. 

"Just get it cleaned up and let's get 
back on the road. We're nearly there."

The driver made to go back into his 
van, but the back slid open. The 
woman, Erika, stepped out. 

"There's trouble," she said. She 
threw the van driver a pair of binoculars. 
He looked down the road into the 
distance. 

Sebastian did the same. All he could 
see was the suggestion of a shimmer 
of heat, some black specks on the horizon.


The driver swore. "Shit, how did they 
know we'd be here?" 

"Is it that hospital?"

"No, dumbass. Do you think 
a psych a hospital is gonna 
chase us half way across the country 
for a single patient? 
It's probably that damned Foundation 
again. They're after you, kid," he 
said to Sebastian. "Now come on. 
Take him and get off the road. You, 
go with them." He nodded at Erika, 
who climbed into the van without 
another word. 

They took the van and ran it off 
the road into the cornfield. The 
rows of plants thwacked into the 
windshield again and again as 
they drove blindly away from the 
road. 

They only got a little ways away 
when the evening was cut with the 
crack of gunfire. The man in the 
passenger seat demanded to know 
what was going on over the radio while 
the driver, white knuckled, steered 
them further into the cornfield.

Static on the radio. They 
continued in tense silence. Another 
crackle of gunfire exploded in the 
air above them. Some of the men 
started to mutter quiet prayers under 
their breath. 

Sebastian looked over to Erika. She 
was wearing an expression of intense 
concentration, as if listening to 
something in the distance. 

No one was prepared when 
they hit a ditch and veered wildly 
through the field. 

Sebastian felt his stomach churn 
as the van teetered dangerously on 
two wheels. Just as he thought for sure 
they would roll over, the car slammed 
back down into the field, lodging itself 
deep into the muddy earth. 

The wheels spun them deeper 
into the earth. The driver swore and 
jumped out. The rest followed. 

Someone yanked Sebastian out of 
the car and dragged him over to the 
ditch where they were taking cover. 

The man in the passenger's seat was 
whispering frantically for some sort 
of response from the other vans, but 
there was only silence. 

Another bout of gunfire made them 
all flinch. Sebastian wondered if it was 
his imagination or if was much closer 
this time. 

The driver had taken command and 
was trying to regroup the others, 
though S. could hear a quiver of uncertainty 
in his voice. 

"No one panic! 
Our comrades will take care of 
the Foundation. But just in case, we 
will form a defensive positions [[take defensive positions]]. Find 
cover and..."

Sebastian reached to the back of 
his neck, still damp with blood. He 
tried to feel out what was written there 
but only succeeded in sending pangs of 
pain down his neck. 

Most of the men were crowded around 
their leader, still listening to his orders. 
One of them wandered off 
back towards the direction they had 
come. It was Erika. 
"They're coming," he heard her say 
quietly. Then louder, "They'll 
be coming from the north and the 
west."

The larger group heard her and 
stopped to listen. 

"The majority are coming from 
the road, through the path we took. 
Twelve men, more or less. A smaller 
group is flanking us from the 
south. Six-ish. No more." 

Sebastian looked down the direction 
where she had wandered, but saw 
nothing but rows of corn. How did she 
know? 

"What about ours?"

"They got past them. 
They may catch the ones coming from 
the north, but they don't know 
about the ones coming in from the West."

The leader's face hardened. "We 
must have faith in our friends. We 
will line up along the trench and catch 
the southward group."

The men dispersed to carry out 
his orders. Erika moved to
take her place in the line but Sebastian 
pulled her aside. 

"What does it say, on my back?"

"Now's not the time," she said, pushing 
past him.

"No, it's important. What does it stay?"

She stopped, looked down and read 
through the smear of blood.

"Neither shall bring freedom, 
neither shall bring death."

[[maybe change this to something about her being about to shoot him]]

She looked at Sebastian oddly, and 
seemed as if she wanted to ask him 
a question, but the driver was issuing 
orders and there were more pressing 
matters at hand. 

As they assembled, readying weapons 
and preparing for battle, Sebastian 
skipped backwards in the trench. 

Normally the things written 
into his skin meant little to nothing, 
to him but occasionally they were 
somewhat interpretable. If Sebastian 
was reading this one right, neither 
outcome of this battle would mean 
anything to him. If he was wrong, 
well, then, it was still a prime 
opportunity to escape. 
Just as Sebastian was about to 
climb over the bank of the trench, 
Erika spun around to see him clamber 
out away from them. But before she 
could say anything, the man 
next to her collapsed with a ringing bang, 
dead. 

Like shadows, their enemies were 
emerging from between the stalks of 
corn. Sebastian didn't stick around 
to see the inevitable carnage. He 
disappeared into the field behind them. 

He ran through the cornfields, barely 
noticing as the thick leaves struck 
at his face and shoulders. He stumbled, 
bare feet in the soft ground. He 
fell hard, unable to catch himself with 
hands cuffed. Agony raced through him 
as his open wounds stung against the 
mud, but he forced himself to his 
feet and began to run again. 

Behind him gunfire continued, 
cracking like thunderless lightning. 
Though exhaustion and pain 
caught up to him quickly,
he refused to 
let his steps falter. 
Then, suddenly, it was silent. Sebastian 
fell to his knees, aching on every inch 
of his body. He heaved for breath, trying 
to hear any signs of pursuers over the 
thundering of his heart. But there was 
nothing. Sebastian caught his breath. 
He stood. 

It was hard to say exactly how far he'd 
run. But hopefully it was far enough 
and the disorientation of the cornfields 
would do the rest. 

In terms of escape plans, this wasn't 
the best. The handcuffs were a problem, 
and so were the bare feet. In earlier 
years, the fresh wounds would have been 
a good excuse to delay any grabs for 
freedom, but Sebastian had been 
a prisoner for long enough to have 
run out of patience for another opportunity. 

All this was workable, he thought. 
He just had to get to a phone, and then...

The wind sent a wave of rustles through 
the corn field. Sebastian looked back 
in the direction he had run. He 
wondered if he could smell blood on the 
wind or if it was only his imagination. 
More likely than anything else it was 
his own. 

Sebastian began to walk. Eventually 
if he continued in this direction he 
should find the road. From there, 
civilization, and then freedom. 

A small part of his mind 
whispered doubts into his ear. It 
was miles and miles since they had 
passed as much as a gas station on 
the drive here. And they had said 
that their base was nearby. Any 
passing cars were more 
likely to belong to his captors than 
not.

Infection, the voice whispered. Blood 
loss. Hunger, thirst, exposure.

Sebastian pushed it from his mind. 
Even if there were a better chance 
he ended up dead than free, 
it was still worth it. 

Sebastian walked further. The 
sun had began to sink beneath the horizon. 
He thought he'd have hit the 
road by now, but there was no sign 
of it. His feet grew numb, then 
achy again. 
It had been a good hour since he'd 
escaped. By now they must 
think he'd been captured by whoever 
the other group was. Maybe they'd left. 
Maybe it was better to retrace his 
footsteps and find the road that way. 

Sebastian was still weighing the benefits 
of each when a noise in the cornfield 
caught his attention. A rustling, a rhythmic 
snapping of corn stalks. It was coming 
from the direction he had come from. 

That made his decision for him. He 
began to run.

"Wait!" A voice called. Higher, 
female. Probably that woman then, 
he thought. She was nice enough, but 
not enough to persuade him to stay. 
He forced his protesting legs to push him farther 
through the cornfields. 

"If you don't stop, I'll shoot," 
she warned, voice 
further back now. Sebastian wasn't 
concerned. The cornfield was the perfect 
cover---there was no way for her to 
know where he was. 

But, as he recalled, there 
was no way for her to have known where 
the armed men were coming 
from either---

An explosion, and then a strike 
of lightning pain in his thigh. His 
leg immediately gave way underneath 
him and he stumbled to the ground. The 
bullet had passed straight through his thigh, 
right across the message of Black Daphne.

Erika emerged from the cornrows, 
reholstering her gun. Sebastian 
writhed on the ground, eyes clouded 
with pain. He heard someone screaming, 
realized it was him. He swallowed 
the screams, heaving for breath. 

"Are you a fool?" she said, standing 
over him. "You'll die out here. 
Infection's already set in." She rolled 
him over his side, 
toeing his thigh. He screamed muffled 
agony. "Rolling around in the dirt 
won't help. Neither does shooting 
you, I suppose."

She knelt beside him to staunch 
the bleeding. 

"You were only a few hundred 
feet from the road, too. You know, you seemed 
so blase when we took you from Bedlam, 
I thought you had no interest in running."

"One prison is the same as any other," 
he grunted through gritted teeth. 
"But freedom is worth getting worked up over."

"You don't need to tell me that," 
she said. "Do you know how tourniquets 
work? Good, then hold onto this 
while I get the others. Don't pass out."

She stood and left him alone to 
grit through the pain. 

"I've got him. Head down the 
road, I'll meet you there. Then let's 
get him back as soon as possible. 
He needs some medical attention. 
If Master Freeman asks what happened, 
tell him it was the Foundation."

---

Sebastian woke up in a hospital 
bed. He felt sore in places he hadn't 
thought he could feel pain. His head felt 
stuffed with cotton and his mouth was 
as dry as the desert.



Just a normal day then.

 Sebastian lay in bed unmoving, wondering 
when whoever his newest caretaker would 
notice him. [[ put before ]] He was restrained to the 
bed by both IV and handcuffs.

He wasn't alone in the infirmary. 
He recognized several of the men 
who had brought him here. They 
seemed to be in worse shape than 
him, but there weren't as many 
as he thought there would be. 
The conflict 
in the cornfield mustn't have been 
too bad then. 

Someone in the room noticed him 
looking around and called the doctor 
over. 

"You're awake much sooner than 
I thought," she said. She was a 
woman in middle age, streaks 
of gray hair and a kind face. 

"Where am I?" he asked, swallowing 
to clear the grime from his throat. 

"This is the home of the Temple 
of the Grand Unification," she said. 
"And your new home as well."

Sebastian didn't particularly like 
the sound of that, but he kept such 
thought to himself. 

"You were very fortunate," she 
said. "You lost a lost a lot of blood. And 
the bullet missed the bone. But you 
should recover fully within a few 
months.

He noticed she didn't mention 
his the [[typo ]] wounds carved into his skin, 
though they were freshly bandaged. 

"Do you know why I'm here?" 
he asked quietly. 

She shook her head. "I do 
not. But now that you are awake, 
Master Freeman would like to 
see you. I'm certain he will know."*  

---

*he should be in a wheel chair 

More men with guns came 
shortly to collect him from the 
infirmary. They shuffled him outside 
before quickly bringing him into 
another building. Sebastian caught a 
glimpse of the same sky of the cornfields. 
Beneath, a compound of concrete buildings 
surrounded by concrete walls. 
The building they brought him too [[typo]] 
was warmer and better constructed: lighting 
fixtures instead of bare bulbs, 
carpet over the concrete floors. The 
long corridor branched off into kitchens, 
dining rooms, offices cramped 
with desks. Sebastian's guards didn't 
let him linger to look long. 

The corridor opened up to a small 
foyer. 
The door at the end was 
constructed of heavy wood in sharp 
contrast to the cheapness of the 
construction of the rest of the building. 
Some symbology was painted in fading 
red over the dark wood. The 
guards knocked twice on the door 
before stepping back. Sebastian 
could smell a faint trace of incense. 

The door opened, seemingly on its 
own. The guards wheeled him into 
the room. 

The room was lavishly decorated. Thick 
rugs covered the hard wood floors. 
Dark would shelves held musty tomes and 
strange artifacts from an assortment 
of cultures. Antique furniture was 
densely packed into the room, throwing 
strange shadows in the dim light. 

A man stood in the center of the 
room. His face was thin and neat. His 
hair was slicked back and his spine 
ramrod straight. He wore red robes 
which hung straight from his shoulders 
to the floor. 

"Make him stand," he said to the guards. 

They uncuffed him and pulled him roughly 
from the chair. Sebastian sunk as his leg 
protested, but they grabbed him by the 
shoulder and kept him upright. 

Sebastian tried to meet the man's eyes as 
he stared him down, but his eyes barely 
glanced at Sebastian's face, going 
straight to the wads of gauze on his 
back, arms, and legs. He walked 
slowly around them. The hair on the back 
of his neck stood straight up as the 
man passed close behind him. 

Sebastian bit back a yelp as he tore 
the bandage from the back of his neck
off. 
"Freedom or death? This appeared 
before the conflict just outside our walls. 
And here he is, neither free nor dead, 
despite his best efforts to the contrary."

The man's voice was quiet and measured. 
Sebastian wondered who he was 
speaking to, as neither of the guards 
reacted.

"They retrieved records of his past 
prophecies from Bedlam, Master Freeman," 
said a meek voice from behind him. 
"They include the doctor's best guesses 
at the meanings of the prophecies, 
including recent natural disasters and 
incidents involving other patients at the 
hospital."

"Thank you, Sasha," he said, 
walking back around to the front of him. 
He held out his hand. A young man, 
at the oldest 18, hurried to deliver 
a sheaf of papers into his waiting 
hands. There was some resemblance 
between them, though what was 
arch in freeman became delicate 
in Sasha. As the 
master studied the papers, Sebastian
tried to catch Sasha's gaze, but the 
youth steadfastly refused to meet 
his gaze. 

"You are called the Augur, then?" he 
said to Sebastian at last. 

"They had fanciful names for us at 
that place," Sebastian said, still 
buoyed up by the two guards on either 
side. 

"Do you or do you not know the future?" 
the man demanded. 

"Prophets know the future. Augurs only 
interpret signs. Lucky for me the signs 
are inscribed into my flesh. I don't miss a 
one." Sebastian did his best to muster up 
any amount of defiance despite the growing 
pain in his leg. 

"Then you don't carve them yourself?"

Sebastian sighed, having explained one 
time too many. "No. they appear on their 
own."

"Then you control the topic? The frequency." 

"No."

"At least, then," he said, losing his 
patience, "you know their meaning."

"Not any better than you do."

The master's fingers 
tightened around the paper, crushing
them. His face screwed itself in rage. 
Sebastian thought he might throw the 
sheet of papers or yell or scream, 
but just as anger was about to 
overtake his composure he reigned 
it back into a sneer. He thrust 
the crumpled papers back into 
Sasha's grasp. Sasha took them quickly, 
eager to please. 

"Have him put in a cell and cared 
for. Document any new prophecies. 
If any, by chance [[emph]], seem relevant, 
report them to me." He turned to leave. 

The guards stood to attention and 
made to dump him back into the chair. 

"Wait," Sebastian protested. The 
master turned back around. "Why 
am I here? Why did you take me from 
that place?" 

"There are decisive times before 
us. If there is knowledge to be gained, 
we will use it to guide us through 
the reckoning. If not," he smiled, 
though there was no joy behind it. 
"then it's simply one more for the collection."

The guards pushed him back down 
into the wheel chair. The master and 
his assistant retreated back farther
into the darkened room of dust 
and antiques. 

---

They put Sebastian in a cell in one 
of the outermost buildings of a compound. 
Plain bed, sink, toilet. Unlike his 
last cell it had a wall of iron bars 
instead of plexiglass. Otherwise it 
was like he had never left the hospital 
at all. 

The bars gave a proper metal creak 
and rattle as the guards slammed them 
shut behind him. Sebastian almost preferred 
them to the glass window. Now there was 
no question that he was truly a prisoner, 
unlike before. 

Because, though Bedlam Psychiatric 
Facility was on the surface a 
mental health clinic, it became 
quickly clear that it had little 
regard for its inpatient's mental 
health. Medical care was minimal, 
limited to little more than what 
was required to keep them alive. 
The clinic's owner was more 
interested in assembling a collection 
of disordered thinking---men and 
women who thought they were animals, 
madmen speaking in tongues, children 
talking to themselves in different 
voices. There he kept on display 
for wealthy guests to ooh and aah 
over the squalor of their minds. The 
boy self inflicting wounds of the future 
seemed like a must-have for his collection. 
When it became apparent that 
they weren't self caused, the 
doctor's interest in him only grew. 
Idly, Sebastian wondered if the doctor was 
upset with the jewel of his collection 
being stolen from under him. But, 
in truth, he didn't care. He was glad to be gone, 
even if his new home was no different 
than the last. 

It seemed that he would be here for 
a while. Though he had seemed to have 
thoroughly disappointed their leader---
Master Freeman---they had no interest 
in letting him go. Escape would be 
impossible[[,]] at least until he could walk on his 
own again. 

Until then he would sleep to pass the time. 

---

A few days later they let him out of his 
cell on crutches. As the guards 
waited impatiently for him the hobble 
down the hall, he realized that 
he was lucky that Dr. ____ was committed 
to making sure he could walk again. 
He wasn't sure that Bedlam would have 
extended him the same courtesy. 

They brought him back to the central 
building where he had met Master Freeman. 
They rounded a corner and before them 
was a huge flow of people, pouring 
through several sets of double 
doors into a darkened room beyond. 
[[Sebastian and his guards joined the flow]] 
and followed the crowd through the doors.

Lingering in the back of his mind had 
been several questions about the nature 
of the so-called Temple of the Unified 
Mind. An occult obsessed leader, 
paramilitary forces, suspicious terminology 
all suggested cult, but at the same 
time, even headed and intelligent 
people like Dr. _____ and most of 
the people he saw seemed like normal
people doing their jobs, albeit in a 
cheaply constructed compound miles away 
from any where. 

There was no doubt now, though. 
Great expense had been taken 
to line the floors with dark 
stained wood. Banners of red cloth 
hung against the wall bearing an 
icon of a tree and its roots in 
the shape of an hour glass. The 
crowd kneeled before the stage in 
tidy practiced rows. Sebastian's guards 
took his crutches and lowered him 
to the ground before kneeling down 
beside him. They lowered their heads 
deferentially. 

Being in such a large 
group of people all silent was unnerving. 
Their heads were bowed, patiently 
waiting. Sebastian resisted the urge 
to do the same just to avoid standing 
out.


There was movement on the stage. 
From some shadowed corner, a line of 
red robed figures walked onto the stage. 
At their head was Master Freeman. 

He spoke with no amplification, 
but his voice carried clearly over the 
hundreds of listening ears. 

"My brothers and sisters," he said. "Thank 
you for gathering here. Thank you for 
your continued efforts in our pursuit of 
the reunification of our shattered 
consciousness." 

The red robed figures dispersed from 
the stage, walking quietly down 
the shadowed sides of the auditorium. 
Sebastian watched them out of the corner of 
his eye. 

"Today, though, I bring you here with 
news of utmost sadness. We are not as 
unified in our thinking as we lead ourselves 
to believe. Despite our best efforts 
to act as one, there is one among us 
who does not share our unwavering 
commitment to our goals. 

"Our dedicated enforcers 
were delivering a shipment of considerable 
importance several days ago. En route, 
only miles away from home, they 
were intercepted by the damnable 
Foundation, attempting to steal our 
prize. How did they know of this?"
he asked, looking out over the 
audience. 

"A traitor," he answered. "Among 
us. But it shall not be for long."

Freeman stepped down from the 
stage and began to walk among 
the rows of his followers. 

"Join me now, my friends. We 
shall exercise the unity of our minds.
Despite the rifts that lie between 
us, let us join our minds and hearts 
and pray deeply for the unity that 
only Yggdrasil may grant. Our devotion 
shall flush the traitor out."

There was a wave of rustles, a 
murmur of clothing and then a renewed 
calm. Beside him, Sebastian's 
guards lowered their heads 
and closed their eyes. Master Freeman 
slowly began to walk down the 
center aisle among the rows of faithful. 

A flicker movement caught his attention
off to the side of the auditorium. Sebastian 
thought it would be the red robed figures from 
earlier, but they stood still, heads bowed 
beneath their hoods. Instead it was a solitary 
[[figure]] dressed in black. It kept pace with Master 
Freeman, walking a few steps ahead, hiding 
in the shadows of the tapestries. 

The figure stopped. Freeman did as well. 
They stood on opposite ends of the row only 
a few off from Sebastian. Freeman 
looked over to it. In response it 
nodded almost imperceptibly. Freeman began to 
walk down the row. 

Sebastian quickly bowed his head as he walked 
near, then raised it again once 
he had walked past. Slowly, he 
took step by deliberate step, keeping 
his eyes locked on the black hooded 
figure. 

Then, another nod. Freeman stopped 
and turned to the man kneeling there. 
The black hooded figure disappeared 
behind the tapestry. 

Freeman thrust his hand out. The man 
flinched, though his opened palm 
only hovered above his head. Sebastian 
looked closer and could see beads of 
sweat run down the back of the man's 
neck. 

"Michael Carberry, your will is not 
aligned with ours." 

The sentence rung out like a death 
knell. Immediately all eyes were opened. 
The red robed figures swarmed from 
the corner of the rooms to grab him. 
Carberry tried to run but his 
neighbors grabbed at his legs. With 
a few precise blows, the red robed 
figures felled him before hoisting 
him up and dragging him from the room. 

In the midst of the commotion, Sebastian 
looked over the sidelines where the 
black figure had disappeared. Now it 
stepped from its hiding place behind 
the tapestry, pulling off its hood.

It was Erika. (( Sebastian 
immediately understood the trick. An 
accusatory sermon made the traitor 
nervous, allowing Erika to pick him out. 
By hiding in the shadows, Freeman 
maintained the illusion of omniscience
while Erika policed for unruly thoughts. )) 
((or)) ((What role did she have with all 
this))

Quickly, as attention was focused on 
Carberry's removal, she shucked the black 
robes and knelt down at the end of 
the row, as if she had been there all along. 

--- 

"I guess I should say sorry for shooting 
you."

Erika set the tray of food down 
on the small table they had allowed him 
in his cell. It had 
become a daily habit to visit him after 
they finished taking pictures of him. 
Something 
to look forward to help him get through 
the process. 

"Really it's the stepping on me and 
rolling me over in the mud that gets to me. 
That and the 'hold your own tourniquet' 
business." 

Erika winced. "Sorry, about that, too."




Sebastian sighed. "Mostly forgiven now. 
I've been through worse."

He saw Erika's hands tighten and she 
looked away. 

"Though you seem almost like a different person 
lately." 

"Side effect of being 
an Empath," she said. "I pick up a 
little too much from the people
around me."

She shuffled away from 
him, guilt obvious.

"Won't you sit down?" Sebastian 
asked. "There's only the bed for now but 
if they gave me table they'll 
eventually let me have a chair."

Erika accepted, though she sat 
as far from him as possible.

"I'll see what I can do," she said. 

"Thank you," Sebastian said, smiling. 
"It's good to have someone on the outside 
that's more or less normal."

"So you've met Master Freeman," 
she said. 

Sebastian nodded. "He didn't 
want to have much to do with me. 
I guess that's a good thing."


They sat in silence. Sebastian watched 
the steam slowly drift away as it grew cold.

"Erika, what is 
this place? It's a cult, isn't it?"

Erika stifled a laugh. "Of course. 
Can you think 
of any other[[scratch]] sane reason to be living out 
in the middle of a cornfield?"

"But, the people seem so normal. Dr. 
____, you. Even the guys who took me 
from the hospital seem like normal 
military types."

"That's because they're just normal 
mercenaries the cult hired. Some of them 
have actually joined since but most work for money."

"Then what about you and Dr. ____?"

"I'm in it because the alternative is 
spending life in a cage. As for Dr. ____, 
well, Freeman has a way of persuading 
people that's not like your average 
cult's."


"Though," she added. "Don't let 
anyone catch you calling it a cult."

Sebastian smiled. "I can't imagine 
why not. You would think they would 
be more open to the name, considering 
they've named themselves Unified Mind. 
Are they really trying to form some sort of 
bizarre hive mind?"

"It's less ridiculous than it sounds," Erika 
said. "After all, there's you and me. And 
many more things much 
stranger than either of us. Freeman collects 
them, and I've seen my fair share as well."

"Is that so?" Sebastian said. 
He leant back against the wall, smiling to himself. 

"You seem pleased to hear that," 
Erika said curiously. "Why is that?" 

"Well, imagine 
what it was like before I met you. One 
day these cuts just started appearing 
on my back. Everyone thought I was inflicting 
them on myself---even I did. Where else 
could they possibly be coming from? 
I thought I was going insane for the longest 
time. But now that I know there's more 
impossible things than spontaneously
appearing wounds, I feel a little more like I 
used to. Just a normal person 
stuck in circumstances 
they can't control."

"I never thought about it that way," said 
Erika. "Things 
have always been this way for me, cages 
and all."

Sebastian snorted. "You know for an Empath, 
you're not very empathetic."

Erika crossed her arms and looked at 
him sidelong. "I try my best. Though 
maybe I try a little too hard." 

---

(( After the traitor scene))

"So you're Freeman's thought police."

The day after the assembly, Sebastian 
was waiting for Erika at the door of 
his cell, arm's crossed. 

"I see you can stand on your own again," 
Erika said evenly. She set Sebastian's tray 
of food beside her on the floor. Sebastian 
didn't seem to be in the mood for visitors. 

"That's a poor attempt at changing the 
topic," he said. "That was you in the black 
robes, wasn't it?"

"Why were you looking into the shadows 
anyways? Even if Freeman's speeches 
aren't all that interesting, I'm sure 
Carberry being dragged kicking and 
screaming should have been exciting 
enough for you."

Sebastian tapped his foot with impatience. 
"I just was. And I saw you, 
sniffing him out. That was you, wasn't it."

Erika sighed. "Yes, it was."

"I thought you didn't care 
about the cult. 
Never mind conducting 
witch hunts for them. Do they 
have you stalk the barracks at 
night, listening for illegal dreams?"

"I don't get why you're so pissed 
with me," Erika said testily. "You 
know I've killed for the cult. You were there. This 
is hardly worse than that." 

"Well, ostensibly that was in self 
defense. And I wasn't there. I ran away." 

"And then I shot you [[emph]]."

Sebastian waved it away. "Whatever. 
I deserved it. But this, using your abilities 
to help the cult, it's---" Sebastian
searched for the words to express his 
frustration. "I though you didn't like being 
an Empath." 

Sebastian deflated, anger giving way and 
leaving him empty. 

"I don't," she said quietly. "It makes me 
do things that I regret 
as soon as I'm away from Freeman 
and his kind." 

"Then why not just, not?" Sebastian 
asked. "If you hate it, why just not do it?"

Erika was silent. Sebastian 
didn't know what to name the feeling 
pulling at his stomach, but knew that he 
didn't need to. 

"You said it yourself," she said, at last. 
"Eventually you just run out of energy to 
care. I could fight it, but day after day, 
trying to figure out which thoughts are mine 
and which feelings are mine
---it's better to feel nothing, think nothing. 
It's why I became a soldier. If I could 
find some way to make it stop, I would. 
But there isn't, so I have to find some 
way to live with it." 

Erika handed the 
tray of food to Sebastian through the slot in 
the door. Automatically, he reached out to 
take it. 

Erika made sure he had grabbed it, 
turned on her heel, and left.

---

The next day, a 
stranger brought his lunch. The next 
day, a stranger came as well. 
The third and 
fourth day, Sebastian could 
entertain that she was busy, but 
as days turned to weeks and weeks 
to months, it seemed that she 
was no longer interested in visiting him. 

After the arrival of this realization, 
time passed quickly, without 
discrimination from day to day. Sebastian 
drifted quickly into his old habit 
of sleeping to pass away the time. 

Sebastian lazily scratched at a healing 
wound, day dreaming. He had just woken 
up from some dream, barely remembered. 
He recalled stuff relating to the brainwashing 
thing [[put in specifics]] but nothing else. 
Though tantalizingly half remembered, he 
preferred these dreams to the others 
that routinely haunted his sleep. 
the dreams of struggling to push open an 
immovable stone door, with the tearing 
wind, pain riddling his body. From these he 
never failed to wake with new carvings 
torn into his body. 

There was a knock at the door to his 
cell. Sebastian sat up. Usually the guards 
didn't bother knocking. 

He tried to keep his heart from leaping 
too high into his chest. 

"Come in," he said, hesitantly. 

It wasn't Erika, as expected. Rather, 
Sebastian recognized the young man 
from his meeting with Master Freeman. 

"Hi," he said. "My name is Sasha 
Bertholt. You're Sebastian the Augur, 
right?"

Sebastian smiled weakly. "Just Sebastian 
is fine."

"Um, well," Sasha's eyes flitted nervously 
to the wounds on Sebastian's shoulders 
and arms. "I have an offer for you." 

"Is this an offer from you personally 
or Master Freeman?"

"From the Temple," he said. "With 
Master Freeman's approval."

Sebastian had an idea of what this
offer might be.

"So, then what is the Temple offering?"

"Membership," said Sasha. "You've been 
here a while now. You haven't had too 
much chance to see what daily life is 
like, but if you're interested, we'll walk 
you through it and show you our teachings. 
Then, at the end, if you're interested 
in our goal, you'll go through the rites 
and be a full fledged member."

*

"And you'll let me out of this cell?"

"Of course," said Sasha cheerily. "Though 
the master will still want daily documentation 
of your prophecies. But otherwise you'll be 
free to go about the compound like the 
rest of us." 

Sebastian wanted to ask about 
outside of the compound, but kept 
the question to himself. 

*((Sebastian's heart leapt.))

"So how will this work?" he asked.

"Well, to start with, I can give you 
this," said Sasha. He placed a black 
hardbound book between the bars 
of Sebastian's cell. "It's writings by 
Master Freeman and Master Bertholt, 
the previous leader of the Temple." 
"Any relation?" Sebastian asked. 

Sasha was pleased he had noticed. "Yes. My late 
mother. And Master Freeman's sister."

"I'm sorry for your loss," Sebastian said. 

"I barely knew her," said Sasha. 
"Master Freeman raised me as his own." 

"I see," said Sebastian. 

"Some new recruits will be arriving 
in the next few days," said Sasha. "When 
they arrive you all can go through the 
process together. Please read through the 
writings in the meanwhile." 

Sebastian got out of his bed and made 
a gesture of picking the book up from the 
slot. 

"Thank you, Sasha," he said. 

"You're welcome," he said happily. "To 
be honest, we should have offered to have 
you join us much earlier. I'm truly sorry 
for the time you've spent alone in here."

Sasha gave a quick bow and excused himself. 
With little else to do, Sebastian took the book 
and began to read.

---
There was a word in his throat, [[this is terrible]] a 
crush of overpowering fear suddenly washed 
over him. Desperately, he needed to---

Sebastian stood in a field of darkness, 
seeing nothing, hearing nothing. Only a moment 
ago, something had seemed so pressing, so 
important. Now only the petering 
out of emotions, lingering long after 
the cause. 

A chill crawled up his spine. A cold wind 
began to blow. Sebastian opened his
eyes. 

The stone gate, Sebastian threw his arms 
over his eyes as the wind began to howl 
around him. 

He stood on a precipice of rocks, 
miles above an empty wasteland of dust 
and rocks. There was nothing but barren
 sand as far as the eye could see. Only 
his tower and the gate. 

The gate. Desperation gripped him and 
before he could stop himself, he 
found himself slammed against the door, 
pushing at immovable stone. The need 
to open the door overrode any sense of 
self preservation. Sebastian felt 
his bones grind against each other, 
muscles screaming in pain. His own 
voice was lost, howling with the wind. 

It was impossible, he thought. He would 
never open the door. 

The wind abated. He felt his muscles relax. 
Slowly he slid does the door, limp. But he 
could not convince himself to let it go. 

He looked up. The stone gate towered 
above him, lone feature on the stone 
tableau, lone feature of the stone wasteland.
Above him the sky was an empty static of 
gray. 

"Do you even know why you fight 
at the gate?" a voice asked. 

Startled, Sebastian scrambled 
against the gate. There was someone sitting at the edge of the precipice. 

"Briefly you've managed to pull yourself 
away. That's a start, I suppose."


"Sasha?" Sebastian asked. His voice 
creaked out, refusing to be pushed into use.

"Not quite," Sebastian heard the 
figure say. It walked towards him, 
wearing Sasha's face and frame, 
but the way it carried itself was wrong. 
Too smooth and too confidently. 

"Who are you?" Sebastian's voice 
stammered as he backed himself against 
the gate. He slipped backwards, 
bruising knees and elbows on the 
rough stone. The man paused. 

"I am the dreamwalker," he said. 
"And try and wake yourself, just a bit. 
It's very difficult to have a conversation 
with you when you're so far into 
the dream."

His words were distant and seemed 
to arrive slowly. Sebastian heard them 
as though they were spoken through 
molten glass. He pieced them 
together slowly.
"This is a dream?"

"Well no, but yes. It 
it is not just 
some fantasy concocted by a wandering 
mind, but you can wake up from it 
none the less."

Sasha but not Sasha reached down 
and pressed a hand on Sebastian's 
chest. The skin there tried to recoil, 
bubbling with blisters. Pain ripped 
through Sebastian's chest. 

"If you do, you and I will talk."

---


The cantina was busy with morning 
breakfast. A table had been set aside for 
the new recruits. It was empty, though, 
save for a single man, reading a book 
with a frown. 

"Uhm, do you mind if I sit beside 
you?"

Sebastian looked up from his book. 
The woman was in her thirties and 
had the look of an academic about 
her. She seemed nervous and was holding
her tray before her like a shield against 
strangeness.

"Sure," he said, giving a symbolic 
scooch over.

Sebastian shut the book as she introduced 
herself. As she spoke he tried to clear 
the testiness from his mind. After his 
dream the previous night, he had woken 
with a new prophecy written on his chest. 
"Dreams are walked before they are 
commanded," it said. Sebastian 
wondered if the man from his dreams 
had decided its content as well as 
its placement. 

Next time Sebastian was determined 
not to let him walk all over him 
like that. Though it was hard to say 
whether that determination would 
follow him into his dreams.

"Sorry, what did you say?" Sebastian 
said, realizing she was expecting 
him to speak.

"I asked what your name was," she 
said, looking a little concerned.

"Oh. Sebastian," he said. "Sorry, 
I had a terrible night's sleep."

Her name was Michelle Graham.
She was a post-doc studying interpersonal 
psychological phenomena. She reached 
out to the temple to study their 
community, and was joining their recruitment 
process for observation. She thought they might be
 concerned with the scientific inquiry, as 
many other...tightly woven communities...
did, but no none she'd spoken with seemed 
to care much. In other ways the temple 
seemed strange---no fanatics, members 
were not overwhelmingly vulnerable or 
disenfranchised. She was excited to learn 
more.

Sebastian wondered what she thought of 
him. The cult had kindly lent him 
some normal clothes as opposed to the 
hospital gowns he had grown accustomed 
to wearing in his cell. A turtleneck 
sweater kept the scars creeping up his 
neck hidden from view. In theory 
he was no different from anyone else, but 
he could push away the 
suspicion that somehow she could tell 
he was different. 

The table of recruits had filled 
as they had spoken. Sebastian
gave them a summary glance. 
Most looked to be 
young adults, recently 
graduated from college---his age, 
Sebastian reminded himself. They 
seemed evenly split between hippy 
art types, gregarious and happy 
to chat about their exploration 
into oneness and the subconscious, 
and others, quieter 
and listening with looks of intense 
concentration.

Michelle jumped into the conversation, 
eager to interview them on how they 
had found the Temple, why they had 
been willing to leave their homes. 

The answers were nearly unanimous. Some 
encounter had uprooted their sense 
of purpose, whether it be drugs, 
tragedy, or a malaise that 
had followed since birth. In the void 
that had been left behind the 
cult, with its message of 
brotherhood and grand purpose, had 
stepped up to take its place.

As he listened to them swap stories 
of the life [[their lives]] before the Temple, Sebastian 
found himself withdrawing from the them. 
What if they asked him how he came 
to be here? Would he say he was 
imprisoned in Bedlam's hospital before 
being stolen here? Would he tell 
them about the prophecies writing 
them into his skin? Their 
stories, terrible jobs, ex boyfriends 
and girlfriends, absent parents, 
made him feel unreal and strange.

But really was his story so different? 
He had lived a normal life until 
it was stricken by inexplicable 
tragedy. He had lost the last 
few years of his life to it, and 
though he still held on to 
the hope he might return to it one 
day, in the meanwhile, what was 
there to fill the void? 

---
The sky was fading to deep blue when 
their regimen [[ended]]. The recruits split up 
to their barracks. Discretely, one 
of their mentors came to take 
Sebastian back to his cell. Sebastian 
appreciated being able to walk around 
not at gunpoint. 

Before returning to the building that 
housed his cell, Sebastian inhaled 
deeply. The air felt crisp and cool in 
his lungs. 

A little hesitantly, his escort held 
open the door to his cell for him. 
She seemed uncertain whether to lock it 
behind him. 

"I'll take over from here."

Both Sebastian and his mentor 
jumped. Neither had noticed Erika sitting 
in the chair between Sebastian's cell 
and the door. She glowered at the woman 
until she left.

"So you stop visiting 
for three months and the first time 
I get out you decide to camp out 
and wait for me in the dark?"


"Disrobe."

Sebastian 
pulled off his shirt 
and removed his pants and other clothes. 

"Remove the bandages."

As ordered, he unwound the bandages 
from his arms and legs, grimacing as 
they stung in the open air. He did 
the same with those on his chest and back. 

"Raise your arms."

Sebastian did so, hearing the 
camera shutter click. 

"Turn around."

The camera shuttered again.

They picked up the camera, 
disassembling it and returning it 
to their case. Sebastian waited for them 
to leave before collapsing 
back onto the cot. He was used to 
such procedures---the 
hospital had him do the same, but 
still he found the[[m]] exhausting. 

"Di'it 'urt."

Sebastian sat up suddenly. He had [[thought]] they
had all left.

Sebastian recognized the man at the bars 
as one of the many guard who cycled 
through the rotation. 

"What?"

"What?" he said in an overblown 
accent. "I said di't 'urt. 
Did. It. Hurt. Your cuts."

He stared pointedly on the scars 
on his shoulders and chest, 
gaze lingering on the newest marks 
on his upper thighs. 

Sebastian felt his throat tighten. 

'"I don't see why that matters."

"D'you do it yourself? Cut yourself up, 
when we aren't looking? His voice 
was a low hiss. Sebastian shivered 
and fought the urge to cover himself. 

"Of course not. That's the most 
idiotic thing I've ever heard."

"Hey, hey," he said, holding up a 
hand. "No need to be rude. Not to the 
man who's got your food."

He held the tray out in front 
of him, wiggling it precariously 
on one hand.




Sebastian sighed. 

"Thank you. If you'll leave it by the 
door, I will grab it momentarily."

"Nuh uh," he said, grinning. "This 
soup is very tipsy, see. Got to hand 
it off, hand to hand. Otherwise who 
knows what might happened." [[typo]]

He repeated the wriggling motion. 
The implication was clear. 

"Okay, fine," Sebastian muttered 
to himself. He rolled off the bed, 
stooping to pick his clothes 
off the floor. 

"Oh no, don't get dressed on 
account of little old me."

Sebastian rolled his yes, went 
up to the bars. 
He held his hands out in front 
of him. 

"Nah, you've got to get closer, 
you need a good grip on it."

Sebastian stepped closer. At long last, 
the guard opened the slot 
but not without a 
blatant leer downwards. Sebastian 
swallowed nervously. 


"Careful now," he said, pushing 
the tray through the slot. Sebastian 
grabbed it. While he did so the, the 
guard reached out with his free hand, 
grabbing at Sebastian's hair. He pulled him against the bars. 

"Charles, now what would your wife 
think if she saw you...disrespecting 
the Master's property like this?"

Charles withdrew his hand as if 
struck. The tray clattered to the ground, 
spilling over him. Charles stumbled away from 
the bars, swearing.

"Fucking snitch," he snarled. 

"Mhm," said Erika dismissively
from where she stood at the bars. "Now 
run along and fetch Master Augur 
here a new lunch before I find 
some more things to snitch about."

Charles stormed out, cussing. Erika 
watched him go disdainfully. 

Sebastian sank to his knees. 

"And what do you want?" he asked, 
trying to keep the tremors in his knees 
from moving up into his voice. 


"Nothing," she said. "I'm leaving now. 
I'll make sure you get your food. 
The nurse is on her way with new 
bandages, too."

Erika turned to leave. 

"Wait!"

"Yes?"

Sebastian grabbed the bars of his cell. 
"Don't---Can you help me change 
my bandages," he said, exhaling. 

"Uh, that's not really my sort of thing. 
But the nurse is just down the hall," she said, stepping back. 

"No, please,' he said. "Please, it has to be you."

Sebastian could see her hesitating. 
He thought she was going to refuse 
but her expression softened. 

"Fine," she said. "Wait here."

Erika left the room. 

Sebastian picked himself off the 
floor. 
In the hall outside he could hear 
Erika negotiating with the nurse. 
After the brief exchange, the 
nurse headed back down the way she 
he [[typo]] had come, Erika in the 
opposite direction.


When she didn't reappear after 
several moments, Sebastian 
grew uncertain. Had she 
changed her mind? Was she coming back?

Footsteps from down the hall. The door 
opened, and Erika was back. 

"Don't have much faith in me 
do you? I was only gone for a 
moment."

Sebastian grimaced. He hadn't 
thought his relief at seeing her return 
was that noticeable. 

"You haven't really done anything 
to inspire any faith," he said. 

"And yet, here you are asking 
me to change your bandages."

"Just take that to mean of my limited options, 
you are the least terrible."

Erika cracked a smile. "You mean 
that lech Charles? Bastard's still 
hanging around in the hall outside 
your cell. His wife can't 
stand the sight of him, but he 
denies any fault in 
himself. Then he does shit like 
[[this]] and wonders why she's leaving
him. Sad, isn't it?"

Erika unlocked the door. 
She slipped the keys into her pocket 
not bothering to lock the door 
behind her.

"You and Charles are close then?" 
Sebastian said, not even attempting 
to hide his disgust.

"Ha! No," said Erika. 
"You haven't figured it out 
yet? I'm an Empath. I feel 
others feelings, and if they're 
close enough, think their 
thoughts. And unfortunately I've 
too often had to be in close 
proximity to Charles to be spared 
the details of his private life." 

Erika pulled a set of gloves 
out of her pocket, sliding 
them over her fingers. 

"It's also the reason you shouldn't 
try and sneak the keys from my 
pocket. No matter how good a pick 
pocket you are, I will notice. 

Sebastian was more than slightly gobsmacked. 
"An Empath? I never
would have guessed. You don't seem 
like the type."

[[ do some guessing game; what are you thinking about? I said empath, not mind reader. but you're thinking about some sort of food. something better than this soup, I imagine. ]]

"I get that a lot. That's why the 
cult wanted me, but when I refused 
to do the 'I sense great anger in you' 
bit, they just delegated me to security."

"I was wondering about that."

"Yeah," she said, quirking a 
smile. "I know. Now, would you 
like to sit down? Let's get this 
over with."

Sebastian sat down on the bed. Erika 
let him redress the cuts within his 
reach. 

Sebastian finished dressing an old 
scrawl on his leg (the unwelcome 
knot will itself untie) still leaking 
gently. He looked up and caught Erika 
staring at him an expression of 
intense thought.

"What is it?" he asked. 

"I used to be in the 
same boat as you---locked away. I 
know how it wears at the mind. I did 
whatever I could to get out. Even if
it's killing for a cause I don't believe 
in. I won't think any less of you if 
you do the same."

"Is that so? I'll keep it in mind," 
said Sebastian. "Can you help me 
out with this one?" he said, pointing 
to a spidery knot of cuts under 
his chin. 

Erika nodded stiffly. 

Kneeling down in front of him, she 
tilted his head up gently. Carefully, 
she checked for signs of infection before 
pressing 
a wad a [[typo]] gauze to his cut. 

"Nervous?" Sebastian asked. He 
raised a hand to hold the gauze in 
place as she fished for the medical 
tape.  His fingers barely brushed against 
his gloves fingertips, but she pulled 
her hand back suddenly, as if burned. [[ make this section more concise ]] 
The gauze fell to the floor.

"Yeah," she said. "Don't like being 
touched," she said, ripping off another 
bandage. 

"Because of the Empath thing?" 

She nodded, keeping her gaze still
averted, though the bandage was already 
prepared. 

"At this distance, to be honest, your 
thoughts are louder than mine," she said. 
"Any closer, touching, 
skin to skin, I lose track of me. And 
I really don't like that, so don't get 
any strange ideas." Erika stared 
him in the eyes to drive home 
the point. They were a piercing gray.

[[ Erika's eyes are black, Sebastian's are gray ]]

"Got it. No touching," he said. 
"Now would you do my back and 
legs?"

Sebastian laid down on his stomach. 

Erika winced. First at the 
angry slashes into the skin, 
their edges torn and ragged 
with violence. Then at the layers 
of crisscrossing scars beneath. What words 
they had written were indecipherable, 
though stray letters here [[typo]]
here or there were 
recognizable, written in twisted and 
raised flesh.

"Does it hurt?"

"What?"

Erika shook her head. "Sorry, 
that idiot Charles is still in the 
hall. These scars look painful,
is what I meant to say. Some of 
these should have been stitched up."

"Well, human menageries 
masquerading as psychiatric hospitals 
aren't exactly known for their standard 
of medical care. I used to care more 
about this sort of things[[typo]]---scars 
and disfigurement, but these days 
it doesn't seem important anymore."

Erika began to wrap the 
still bleeding wounds. With her 
careful, deliberate touch, Sebastian 
was reminded that she probably knew 
what he was feeling [[even]] if he 
didn't say it. 

"How long has this been going 
on for?"

"Five years now. It started 
my second year of university. Turns 
out my parents [[ aunt and uncle? ]] only had enough 
patience and money for two years of 
wild goose chases and puzzled doctors. 
[[ Do this thing where the way he talks about them changes through the story ]] 
When Bedlam was willing to take me 
in, they jumped at the chance. I 
haven't seen them since." 

 "You don't seem too upset about it."

"You mean, I'm not too upset about 
it," [[That must mean that I'm not too upset about it]] said Sebastian, smiling through 
the sudden pain as Erika pressed 
the gauze into the open wounds.
[[ she flinched and murmured an apology ]]


"Yeah," Erika agreed. "You get it now."

"You just run out of energy to care, 
eventually. If I could get out of here, 
I would. But there's no point in agonizing 
over it. I suppose you've been through this
yourself.

Erika moved on to his legs. "I suppose 
that I have." 

"What about you?  How long have you 
been an Empath?"

Sebastian could feel her hesitate, 
fingers hovering over his skin.

"For as long as I can remember," she 
said, unfreezing. Efficiently, she began to 
wind tape [[typo]] 
shut the cuts on the back of his legs. 
"She thought I was mentally 
handicapped, my mother, because I 
wouldn't let go of her, wouldn't 
learn to speak. When she died, and I 
actually became myself, I learned 
quickly. Unfortunately, remarkable 
orphans attract unsavory attention. 
An organization much like your 
human menagerie picked me up
soon after. It was an interesting world 
to wake up to."

Erika taped down the last of the 
bandages. "How is that? Too tight?"

Sebastian pushed himself off the bed. 

"No, just right, thank you."

Freshly bandages, he began to 
dress. Erika averted her gaze. 
Sebastian found 
a little strange, considering that 
she had only been a step short 
away from---

"Please don't finish that 
thought," she cut in. Her face was 
bright red. 

Sebastian snorted 
to stifle his laughter, ultimately failing 
and bursting into riotous laughter. Quickly, 
it grew out of control, until he was 
doubled over and in tears.

Sebastian heaved to catch his breath, 
wiping tears from his face. The sudden 
outburst of emotion had caught him 
off guard. Looking over at Erika, 
it seemed she had been as well. 

"I'm sorry," he said. "It's just been 
a while since I've felt, well, normal. 
You're very easy to talk to."


"If you say so," she said dubiously, but there 
was a hint of a smile on her face. 

"Will you stop by again sometime?"

"I'm on prison duty every three weeks. 
But I can pull some strings," she said. 
Sebastian assumed by strings she meant 
blackmailing whoever was on rota with 
their own secrets. 

"Great. I'll see you soon then?" 

"Yeah," she said, smiling, though 
she seemed embarrassed at herself. "Soon." 
"So you don't show up for three 
whole months, and then first time 
I'm gone you decide 
to camp out in my cell, in the dark?" 

"You're joining the cult," she said, 
ignoring him. 

"I don't exactly have anything 
better to do," he said coldly. 

"I wouldn't recommend it." 

"Well, what should I do instead? [[ What would you recommend I do instead? ]] Rot 
away in this cell? You said it yourself," 
Sebastian shot back, remembering she had 
done the same to him, "that I should 
do what I could to get out of here. If 
you're not going to help then I'll help 
myself." 

Erika sighed, dragging a hand over her 
face. "I know. But don't go through their 
recruitment process [[initiation]]. Find something else to 
do."

"Like what? Be a mercenary? Sorry, but 
I don't particularly feel like killing people 
or keeping them caged up in prisons." 

"I know!" said Erika, raising her voice. 
Sebastian flinched. She seemed startled at 
her own anger. "I know," she repeated, 
softer. "But you can't go
through with it. You won't come out of it 
the same."

She seemed genuinely concerned, 
maybe even scared. "What do you mean?"

"They have some way of changing you. 
I don't know how, but people who come 
out of it aren't the same as they went in."

[[what do you mean, not the same; I can't describe it]]

"So far it's been fine," Sebastian said. 
"We just toured the compound, they asked 
us some questions about our beliefs. I 
was expecting more brainwashing to be 
honest. [[I've had to deal with more brainwashing from traveling salesmen.]]"

Erika shook her head. "Not yet. It happens 
later. There's this.. thing at the center of 
the compound, underground..."

"Did you go through it?"

"The tried to make me, but I saw what 
it was doing to the people before me. 
They had to hold me down, and they were 
touching me when it happened."

"So it didn't work?"

"I'm not sure. I don't think so. But 
Freeman didn't seem to know the difference."

"So you go out of it," Sebastian said, 
leaning against the bars. "It can't be that 
bad then, if people are still more or less
the same."

"You would think, but then why would someone 
like Dr. _____ stay? She's got opportunities 
everywhere. She doesn't need to be 
here. Same for the other 1000 people in 
this place. Freeman's guards are more 
for his collection than his flock."

"Would it be so bad, wanting to stay 
here?" Sebastian asked, in a low 
voice. "If I'm stuck here anyways."

"No!" Erika grabbed at the bars. 
Sebastian jumped back. "Don't follow 
that man. Give up on escaping, join the cult, but 
don't let that man into your head. His 
thoughts are... insidious. Vile." Erika's hands were 
shaking on the bars. "Don't believe in him."

"Erika," Sebastian said softly. She looked 
up, surprised. But he didn't 
know what to say to her.

"I've done what I can," said 
Erika. "You know what's coming. I don't 
know how else to help you."


"Thank you," Sebastian said. "I thought 
you'd forgotten about me."

"No," she said. "Not really. The 
guards barracks are next door. I can 
feel you from there."

Sebastian wanted to ask why she had 
stopped visiting, if 
he should apologize for 
something he had said. But he decided 
against it. Some other time, he thought, 
if Erika would let him. 

[[ maybe too far into Sebastian's head. ]]

"It's good to know you're 
looking out for me. I'll try to to do good 
by that."

"Yeah. Good luck with the recruitment 
process. I'll see you later. Before the 
end."

"I'll try not to be too brainwashed 
by then," Sebastian said. 

Erika smiled weakly at him. She 
pushed herself back upright, looking 
unsteadier than she had come in. 
Quickly, she composed herself. 

She, too, hesitated, before locking 
the door behind her.

--- 


After a few days the novelty of being out 
of his cell had begun to wear thin. 
Lectures on cult history and exercises 
in expanding one's mind 
could only hold his interest for so long, 
though Sebastian made sure to keep an 
appearance of studiousness.

No ideas were forthcoming about how 
to avoid whatever it was that 
Erika had warned him about. It hung 
over his mind like a dark cloud. 

Their shepherds had given them a 
moment of down time, which they 
could choose to spend on either 
meditation or study. The majority 
of their group had gone to the 
courtyard to meditate, leaving Michelle 
and Sebastian alone in the cult 
library.

Library in name only, Sebastian was 
disappointed to find. There were books 
in abundance but they were all copies 
of the same volume Sasha had given 
him earlier. With nothing better to 
do, Sebastian flipped through, 
reading passages at random. 
"The separation of our senses of 
selves, while at first appearance 
as concrete and indisputable as 
the physical world, is in truth, 
an arbitrary and mutable as 
the other problems that plague 
our emotional lives. Separation 
of self is an illusion adopted 
for the sole purpose of convenience. 
The illusion can be cast off, but it 
requires no small amount of 
effort to free ourselves of the shackles 
of the way we have been taught to think 
since birth..."

"Interesting, isn't it?"

Sebastian looked up from the book. 
Michelle was doing the same 
across the table from it.

"Is it? It's not really my kind of thing," 
he said hesitantly. 

"It's not mine either," she 
admitted. "But it's still interesting. Especially 
the bits by Master Bertholt, and 
even Master Freeman's older work. It's 
almost... scientific. Back then their 
writings about the Unified Mind
are less religious philosophy and more 
like methodical inquiry.

Sebastian flipped backwards in the 
book, skimming the pages he'd 
already read. Jumping backward, he 
could see the gradual stylistic changes 
he had missed reading through from front 
to back. 

"When I get back to civilization 
I'm going to look them up, Freeman 
and Bertholt and the other founders. I 
bet they've published something 
academically elsewhere."

"Are you leaving soon?" Sebastian 
asked.

"Yeah. The final rites are in 2 
days, right? I have to ask to see if 
they'll let me observe without participating. 
If not, I'll probably head out today or 
tomorrow."

[[ probably make it so the initiation is mandatory ]]

"How are you leaving?" Sebastian asked, 
carefully keeping his voice steady. 

"I'll catch a ride with 
one of the vans picking up supplies," she said. 
[[ Why do you ask? ]] [[getting cold feet?]]

"Hmm," Sebastian hummed, and 
dropped his eyes back down to the book.


"So, did you learn what you came here 
for?" Sebastian asked after a moment.

Michelle nodded. "I'll 
be writing a report as soon as I get 
back. Hopefully with my colleagues we 
can synthesize a good summary of 
what it is that attracts people to 
cults---oops, I mean communes
." she said, looking around sheepishly. 
Their mentors, chatting in the corner, 
didn't seem to notice though. "Though 
there is one data point that's a 
bit of an outlier," she said.

"What is that?" Sebastian responded. 

"You," she said, eyes smiling. "I was 
going over my notes---I barely have 
anything on you at all."

"Ah," said Sebastian. He tried to 
think of an adequate response, but 
none were forthcoming. He looked back 
down at his book. 

Michelle didn't seem put off by 
the rudeness.

"You've got an accent---are you from 
the UK?" she asked.

Sebastian rested the book on his

lap. "Yeah."

"What part? When did you come to the 
US?"

"I used to live with my aunt and uncle 
in Hampsted. Went to Cambridge 
for uni," he said automatically. "I 
haven't been back for three years." [[ since I left three years ago.]]

"So you're 25 then?"

"Twenty four," he said. 

Was he really that old 
already? The years had passed so 
quickly from beneath him. 

Michelle must have seem something 
in his face. She hurriedly looked 
down at her book. Not for long though. 

"So how does a Cambridge man end 
up at a commune in middle America?"

"I was only there for a year," said 
Sebastian flatly. "Dropped out." 

"Question still stands."

Melissa raised her eyebrows. Sebastian 
met her gaze flatly. 

"I'd rather not say," he said. 

"Why not? You'll get no judgment from 
me. The rest of our group---
addiction, prison, abuse, the works. 
It could be any worse than that, could it?"

"It's not," he said quietly. 
"It's just complicated."

"Does it have to do with you 
[[ always ]] wearing a scarf indoors?"

Sebastian flinched. He looked 
down quickly, pretending to read again.
 He waited for Michelle 
to stop look away as well, feeling 
his ears burn.

But why not tell her? She was a stranger 
to him. After a few days, he'd 
never see her again. 

"I got sick," he said, voice low. 
"None of the doctors knew what 
was wrong with me. After a few years 
I gave up on ever getting better." 

Sebastian could see she still 
had questions---the holes in his story 
were glaringly obvious.


After a few years I gave up on ever getting 
better. 
I made a mistake 
and let it take over my life, even though 
when I think back now, there was no reason 
why it needed to. I've been trying to 
undo it ever since." 

"And this is part of that?" 

"I guess so," said Sebastian. 

"Then congratulations," said Michelle. 
"I hope you get better soon." 

"Yeah," said Sebastian, feeling the ache 
of five years worth of scars.

---  

Another night, another dream of the 
stone gate. This time he 
awoke with twin cuts on his forearms. 

The heart of the infinite 
fields, mindless

Given thought 
by the aspirations of machine and man.

Sebastian called the guards for the 
nurse and they quickly bandages the 
new wounds.


Sebastian waited until they had left 
before trying to parse 
through his dreams. 

He stared at his newly bandages 
forearms. The dreams of the gate were 
as always, clear and fresh in his mind. 
The frustration, struggling against the 
impossible, followed him into waking 
life. This time the frustration was 
doubled. The dreamwalker, the man 
he had seen before, was there again, 
trying to speak to him, but Sebastian 
had been unable to pull away from 
the gate, unable to understand his 
words over the howl of wind. 

There had been some other dream, 
too, before the stone gate. Something 
barely remembered, 
yet it hung like a weight on his mind. 
Though he could not say why, he was 
sure it had something to do with whatever 
it was, at the heart of the compound.

Which he would be seeing tomorrow. He 
wanted desperately to talk to Erika, 
to know what she made of the prophecies 
that had appeared since her 
last visit, to know more about the 
initialization [[ initiation ]] and how to avoid the 
thing waiting for him. But she had 
not come to visit him since, and 
Sebastian didn't know how to find her 
otherwise. 

One day left to find a way to avoid 
being "changed." If Erika wasn't going 
to assist him he'd have to turn towards 
his dreams.

Sebastian went back to sleep. 

--- 

A moment of stunned silence. Sebastian 
was suddenly unsure where he was, how 
he got here. All he had was an overpowering 
sense of solitude. He clung to it like a liferaft. 

Then there was stone against 
his feet, the gate at his hands. 
His shoulders and thighs burned 
like fire with exertion. 

There was the tiniest sliver in the 
gate. Sebastian's arms collapsed and 
he found his face pressed against it. 
Though he could see nothing, only 
a hint of silvery light. 

All this time and that was it? Would
it ever budge. 

Why, he thought, why am I bound to 
this impossible task? Why can't I just 
leave it be?

He could feel the eyes of the 
dreamwalker on him, but he couldn't 
bring himself to look away from the 
gate. 

"Do you want to be doing this forever?" 
he heard in his ear. 

"No," he mumbled. "I'm so tired."

"Then, just stop. Just sleep. Fall 
asleep and dream."

The exhaustion was over powering. Sebastian 
felt it suddenly surge up through his limbs. 
They folded under him, leaving him 
collapsed against the stone gate. His eyelids 
grew heavy. He let them close once, 
twice. 

The howling of the wind stopped. 
Sebastian looked up. The sky was a 
balmy blue. 
Sebastian bolted upright. 

"What happened?'

The dreamwalker was wearing Michelle's 
face this time. 

"You don't dream much, do 
you? I thought I might catch you in a 
normal dream, but 
you don't seem to have them. I 
had to make do and bring you to someone 
else's. You didn't need to bring that with 
you, though."

She pointed to something behind Sebastian. 
He looked behind him The stone gate 
was still there, looking very much out of place 
in the midst of the pebbled beach. 

((Beh, these dream sequences are terrible))

Sebastian stood unsteadily, leveraging 
himself against the gate. Now that he was 
standing, he looked up at the gate, 
seeing it properly for the first time.

It was carved from gray black stone, 
rough hewn and without adornment. 
It was freestanding on pillars 
twenty feet tall. [[ It seemed ludicrous that he could ever hope to move even one of its giant doors.]]
Sebastian's hand was still pressed 
against the cool stone. Hesitantly, 
he tried to pull it away.

It came free. Nothing terrible 
happened. 

"Was that 
it? Am I free now?'

"From the gate?" she said. "No. 
This is just a dream. [[ unlike your normal dreams ]] 
The gate is still there, in your 
mind. You're still there too, struggling 
against it." [[You always are, even when awake.]]

"I guess it was too good to be 
true," Sebastian said. 

He looked around. The sky and 
the ocean were the hazy blocks of color 
and sound. The pebbles of beach 
were in high resolution, though, 
radiating heat and the smell of salt. 
Sebastian bent to pick one up but 
the dark stone of the gate away 
at the substance of the dream beneath 
his fingertips. 
"You said you wanted to talk," he 
said, straightening. "Who are you, 
and why are you in my dreams?"

"I am the dreamwalker," she said. 

(( If he's got a different face, S. 
probably doesn't recognize them. ))

"I'm here because I've been cursed, 
or blessed, to walk the dreams of 
mankind long after my body is gone."

"Including mine?" 

"Including yours," she said. 

"Sebastian tried to study her face. 
The essence of it was there, but 
the details seemed fuzzy and incorrect. 
The more closely he looked the stranger 
it seemed.

"Why me? I haven't had 
a real dream since the prophecies 
started appearing," he said. "Just the 
stone gate."

"That's exactly the reason. 
After several millennia of dream walking one 
gets bored of seeing the same human 
dreams again and again. Something
new is a change of pace."

"New?" Sebastian asked. 

"I misspoke. Not new, but 
old," said Melissa, sitting on a 
boulder she had just materialized [[ for ]] herself. 
"Ancient. The dreams of the gate 
have ceased for the last 10,000 years. I 
was very surprised to see it again in the 
age of the written word and of airplanes."

[[ "Ancient. It's a calling that I thought I had long since taken its last. But here you are in the age of written word and airplanes, 10,000 years too late."

"there are others like me? Can I meet them?"

"They're not a social bunch. Not inclined to watch over their young, seeing as most of them were created all at once as mankind first dawned into consciousness. Even if they were inclined to speech, ]]

"Then, do you know what's happening 
to me? Do you know how to make it stop?"


"No," she said. "And I suspect that no 
one else in the world does. It 
faded from the world's memory long ago." 

[[ They retreated from the world's memory long ago.]]

Sebastian's face fell. He walked 
back to the gate. The beach 
seemed to grow distant and gray, 
disappearing into the sky-less 
wasteland. 

"But I have seem the dreams of 
your kind, as they began to ascend. 
There is much they are capable of, 
and it lies behind that door. But 
you won't open it as you've 
been doing now. Maybe remember that 
next time you find yourself there."

As the dream of the beach began 
to stretch and fade, the dreamwalker 
began to fade with it.

"Wait!" Sebastian called out as the 
winds of the stone tableau began 
to blow. "Wait, you've seen my dreams. 
There are other ones, not the stone 
gate. Have you seen them? 
Do you know what they are?"

"I have," she said, voice faded and barely 
audible over the rush[[ing]] wind. "But
you cannot know them until you open 
that door."

And then she and the beach were 
gone. Sebastian turned back to the 
stone door and began to push. 

---

Sebastian awoke with 
a foul taste in his mouth. The 
lights of his cell were 
off. Judging by the sounds from 
outside, it was night again. He 
had slept the entire day away. 

Even so, he felt exhausted. He 
had learned next to nothing from 
the dreamwalker, and still could 
remember nothing about the forgotten 
dream, though he could remember 
its importance---the vitality of acting 
[[in]] with response to it.

There were new prophecies as well. 

Her captivity enslaves more than 
herself. (( Erika sells him out ))

and

The unconscious mind abhors 
its children ((pain keeps him 
from the corn mind))

Neither filled him with any confidence. 
He bandages them away and tried 
to put them from his mind. Before, 	
years ago, when his affliction was 
still new, he had obsessed over them, 
trying to find meanings in the messages 
in his skin. 
His obsession grew as it became 
apparently they referred to future events. 
But often, there was nothing to 
be gained from them---their interpretation 
cloudy until the event they prophesied 
had already passed. Eventually, 
Sebastian had stopped caring. [[ p break ]] With 
the future uncertain, he felt the 
obsession returning, but he 
knew that it would do him no good. 
Any attempt to augur them was no 
more than shooting in the dark. [[ some word is missing ]]

Certain, though, was that this was 
possibly his last night in his cell, 
possibly his last night free from the 
cult's influence. Locked inside, there 
was little he could do with this certainty. 

He resolved to wait out the night.

---


Bright and early, they brought him out 
of his cell. He was almost relieved to 
see him [[them]], worrying having eaten at his 
thoughts the whole night long. 

He and the other recruits were gathered 
into a small clearing of sparse grass 
and directed to meditate with the sunrise. 
After the exercise, he went to find Melissa.

"I will miss all the mindfulness and 
meditation, once I'm gone. Not easy 
to make time for it in modern life," 
she said, stretching luxuriantly in the 
cool morning air. 

"So you're staying 
for the initialization, then?" Sebastian 
said. 

"Oh yes. They said it was fine to 
participate, even if I was [[ though I'm just going to ]] just going to 
leave afterwards. All this has been a bit 
more hands-on than I thought, but I 
have to say, I liked it in the end."

"That's good," Sebastian said. "Though 
maybe you should avoid the last 
rights. [[ rites ]]"

"Why do you say that?" Michelle 
seemed surprised. 
"No, never mind," said Sebastian. 

Michelle raised an eyebrow. "I missed 
you yesterday. Where were you?" 

"Health related," said Sebastian, 
mostly telling the truth. 

Nerves kept Sebastian on edge through 
the morning. He asked Michelle about 
her research to try to distract himself, 
but found his focus continually 
pulled away to the dreams, to his 
wounds, to Erika's warning. His worries 
sat like a pit in his stomach. Again, 
he knew what 
was coming, again there was nothing 
he could do about it. 

After going through the motions of prayer 
and meditation, at last they brought 
them to the compound's main building. 
Sebastian recognized the way 
to the main hall. 

The room was empty. Their footsteps 
floated up to the beams with motes 
of dust from the scant sunlight let in 
by small windows. 
Sebastian looked around the room. After 
the exercises of the initiation process 
he recognized now the symbology in 
the decorations. The encircle circle 
as the symbol of the unified mind, the 
flourishes as waves for the flood of 
joined consciousness. And the tree, 
Yggdrasil, which bore fruit of 
all conscious minds, joining them 
together by its branches.

Honestly, it was all so disparate 
and confusing, Sebastian wondered if they 
had a mad prophet (other than him) 
dreaming these things up. Neither 
Freeman nor the late Bertholt 
seemed the type. (( It's the corn plant ))

Their mentors led them from the 
back of the hall to the stage 
in the front. As they neared the stairs, 
they were joined by others in a row 
of red lined robes. 

Freeman was waiting for them 
on the stage. 

They stood before them, wearing
white robes. Those in red lined up 
behind Freeman, keeping their faces 
hidden behind their hoods. 

"Thank you for joining us in our 
mission of unification," he said when 
they had settled. His eyes swept across 
the faces of the recruits, eyes forward. 
They paused for the 
briefest moment on Sebastian with 
recognition. "Thank you for dedicating 
your hearts and minds to this cause that 
is greater than any one of ourselves."

"Some of you may still have doubts 
about our grand unification. You may 
believe in it, but only as something 
abstract to be achieved on a personal 
level. But our return to our ancient 
one-ness is real and concrete. Today 
I show you but a taste of the eventual 
fruits of our efforts,---a world of 
joy, without pain or disloyalty. 
An experience beyond worldly minds."
[[ fruits of our efforts, an experience beyond worldly minds---a world of joy, without pain or disloyalty." ]]

Freeman's speech was still calm and 
measured, but his eyes had the 
fever brightness of a fanatic. 
Out of the corner of his eye, he 
spied on his fellow recruits. They 
seemed excited, eager to 
experienced the promised 
revelation. Sebastian supposed any skepticism had been conditioned out. 

(( have the mentors hype this up ))

"Please, if you would, follow me."

Two red-robed figures came forward 
and lifted a section of the floor out. 
Underneath was an old wooden stair 
case leading into the dark. 

Freeman and half the red robed 
figures went below first. The other 
half stayed above, presumably to 
ensure all of the recruits followed. 

In a neat line they followed 
Freeman down the stairs. Sebastian 
paused at the top of the stairs, 
feeling suddenly lightheaded. 
But he continued before any of Freeman's 
guards could hurry him along. 

The air grew strangely 
warm and wet as they marched further 
underground. The old staircase creaked
and groaned under the weight of its 
twenty-some occupants. 
Fistfuls of cables and open lightbulbs 
were anchored into the dirt walls, 
providing just enough light 
for them to make their way down the 
stairs. 

It was only a short way to the bottom. 
The staircase deposited them at the 
crossroads of several tunnels, floors 
and ceilings still composed of damp 
soil. Sebastian wondered how it didn't 
collapse. 

The wires and lights 
ran only along one tunnel. 
They set off in that direction. 

As they walked down the hall, 
Sebastian saw several branches off into 
other directions. Their path as well, 
wove wildly through the earth. Without 
the string of lights to guide them, 
they would be lost within moments. 
Sebastian tried not to imagine
what would happen if they lost power. 

No one spoke as they made their 
way through the tunnels. The other 
recruits looked around curiously, no 
doubt astounded by the extent of these 
tunnels. But the guards in red 
marched on without much reaction; 
they had been here before. 

At last, they arrived at their 
destination. Several tunnels met here, 
opening up to a chamber only a little 
wider than the tunnels themselves. 
The walls were still made of 
dirt, but were lined with white 
wriggles--plant roots, Sebastian 
realized. At the center of the chamber 
was a strange device. 

It reminded Sebastian of a cage. 
Metal rods arranged in a circle 
ran upwards into the chamber's ceiling. 
Cables and tubing were scaffold on them 
connecting to something above, unseen in 
the dark. From the center dangled 
more white roots, entangled 
with wires rustling from 
damp air. Though the air was still, 
they undulated slightly, 
squidlike. 

A wave of uncertainty moved through the 
recruits. 

"Dim the lights," 
said Freeman. 

One of the guards in red flipped 
a switch on at the base of the structure. 
They were plunged into darkness. 

For a moment the blackness was 
absolute. The lights down the 
tunnel had turned off as well. 
Sebastian felt a thrill of fear run 
through him. There was no way to 
run away now. 

There, in the dark, he saw the 
faintest of glows. At first it was so 
slight Sebastian thought it was only 
an afterimage in his eyes, but slowly 
it grew brighter, solidifying. 

It looked like a heart, but crowned 
with plant roots instead of veins. 

[[ Around it, indicator lights of various machines began to blink on. A cool floodlight illuminated the
machine with white light. 

The red robed figures produced devices and began attaching them to the wires hanging from the ceiling. Among them were a set of bulky headphones and goggles. They set them down on stool. 

Nix on the goggles, but the rest might be good. ]]

"Please proceed into the chamber," 
Freeman said. 

Nervously, the first recruit in the line 
stepped forward. Taking short, stilted 
steps, she allowed herself to be 
directed to the center of the machine.

[[ Maybe do a short bio on each one? ]]

"Reach up," he said. "Hold on to the roots."

Tentatively, she did as directed. 
For a moment, she looked around confused, 
expecting further instructions. But then, 
her eyes lost their focus. 
She closed them. Her hand, entangled 
in the roots above her, tightened. 

Barely a moment later, she let
go. She opened her eyes. They were wet 
with tears. 

She opened her mouth as if to speak, 
but said nothing, as if unable to find the 
words. 

On unsteady limbs, she left 
the chamber. Freeman met her, 
murmured something quietly to her. 
He then reached behind her and pulled 
the hood over her head. He directed her 
to stand with the others in red robes. 

A murmur ran through the recruits. 
Curiosity, confusion. What had happened? The 
next in line approached the roots 
with some eagerness. 

The same happened. Just a moment 
holding the roots and he stepped from 
the center, tears in his eyes. 

[[ Michelle should be a skeptic. How does a skeptic end up with the recruits? ]]

"What was it like?" someone blurted out. 
But no one chastised him. 

"It was... sublime. 
It's like nothing I've ever seen before, 
or will ever see again."

"One day we may see it again," said 
Freeman, taking him by the shoulder. 
They moved quickly through the line of 
recruits. After each, Freeman spoke 
quietly to them before sending them off 
to stand with the other guards. 

One of the figures in red hung near 
Freeman, standing at his side as he 
spoke to the newly initiated. As each 
turned to join the line, he saw them 
briefly lock eyes and the hooded figure 
nod. 

Erika again, making sure the new 
recruits were properly "changed". 
Sebastian gritted his teeth. So Freeman 
was assured all his new recruits were 
properly indoctrinated, except Erika herself. 

[[ he should really be more pissed about the hypocrisy here ]]

Perhaps detecting his flash of anger, 
she looked over to him, but 
her eyes passed over his face as if he 
were nothing but an unremarkable 
section of wall. 

Michelle was next. 
While attention was directed to one 
recruit, breaking down in sobs at Freeman's 
feet,Sebastian nudged her elbow. 


"You shouldn't do this. Just step 
out now." 

"Why?" she whispered back. "How bad 
can it be?" 

"Do you even know what happened to them?" 
Sebastian said, nodding to those who 
had gone before. They seemed lost in 
contemplation, though those who had gone 
first seemed 
to have mostly returned to normal. 

"Some sort of psychoactive chemical, 
looks like," said Michelle. "Pretty 
standard for religious experiences. It looks 
pretty short acting, too." 

Sebastian shook his head. "It's not. It's 
something more than that. It changes your[[you]], 
irreparably. It cements your allegiance 
to the cult."

"What are you talking about? It's just 
some sort of drug."

"It's not!" Sebastian hissed. 

"It must be. The stuff you're saying doesn't 
even make sense. It's impossible."


"There are many things that seem 
impossible. This is only one of them."

Melissa looked at him as if he were 
crazy. 

"It's true!" he said to her. "I'm one 
of them."

He pulled back the arms of his robes. 
The wounds from the previous night 
were there, ugly and red. She looked at 
him in horror. 

"Who did that to you?" 

"No one. They happen on their own."

She still didn't believe him. Sebastian 
fought the urge to pull at his hair. 

"Don't go, Michelle. It's not worth it."

"Michelle Bantwin." It was Freeman. 
He stood by the machine. "There is not a problem?"

Freeman spoke to Michelle but his 
eyes were on Sebastian. Sebastian 
realized that before today 
he might not have known he was being 
initiated. 

"No, Master Freeman," she said, 
voice quavering slightly. She turned 
away from Sebastian and went into 
the clearing.


(( make the message S. shows her say 
something about supplanted wills. Also, 
rework the actual thing.))

Eyes on Sebastian, she reached upward 
and grabbed ahold of the roots. It took 
only a moment for them to grip her. 
Tears began to stream down 
her face as she lowered her head, shaking. 

[[ maybe they have to climb up there or something weird like that. could be cool. ]]

"I see now, " she said. "I was so wrong."

Sebastian watched as Freeman murmured 
in her ear, and pulled her hood over 
her head. At this distance, he could hear 
him speak. 

"There is no higher calling, than to 
bring this to the rest of humankind, is there?" 

"No," she whispered back. "None."

"We can find a place for you here."

"Thank you," she said, eyes bright with 
whatever vision she had experienced. 

Freeman sent her away to the others. 
He turned to Sebastian. He was next. 

Feeling numb, he stepped forward. 
His legs felt wooden beneath him. 
The urge to run rose up in his chest. 
but under Freeman's gaze he felt 
paralyzed. Sebastian walked to the 
center of the room. 

It was too late now, he thought as 
he looked around the room. 
Freeman and the others 
were watching expectantly. 
He questioned whether it was worth 
it, freedom from his cell or his 
freedom of thought. Somehow he had 
been so sure that he wouldn't have 
to choose. Why had he been so certain?

Because of the dreams, because of 
the prophecies. [[Because of Erika]] A solution had seemed 
just out of reach, but he had 
never managed to grab it. 

Why was there never anything he 
could Do? Sebastian reached up and 
grabbed the roots. 

--- 

Blue sky. The sun warmed soil. In 
the distance a tower of thunderheads 
released a deluge of rain. He 
felt it batter against him though 
the sky above him was clear. 




The strangeness of the sensation registered 
only for a moment before it was swept 
away by a wave of wind, sweeping 
over him---no, across him, through 
him. 

The strangeness returned. Across 
what? Through what? The drum of 
rain and the beat of sun was not 
on his skin, nor 
his arms and legs. The exuberance 
of growth and the burrowing into rich 
soil, these sensations weren't his own. 
Rather, he realized, it was the 
fields of corn---their leaves, their 
fruit, their spreading roots. 

Then, where was he? At once 
between the sunwarmed air 
among the leaves and the cool 
shade of the stalks, at once deep in the sunless 
earth. Was that really him, sealed 
in tight skin and untidy muscle 
and rigid bone? So small, so weak, 
so alone compared to the fields,
the corn, its pollen in the wind, 
even its symbiotes and parasites, the 
great system of life tied together 
at a heart no larger than a human 
fist. 

The humans, too, were part of it
---harvesting, fertilizing, resowing. Strange 
keepers and reapers of life. There 
was a hunger here, for something 
like understanding but not quite. More 
like a greed, to spread, to expand, [[ to reach into fertile substrate ]] to 
incorporate this external part of its 
ecosystem that not even the glut of lives 
the cult had offered could satiate. 
[[ The cult should have done something to give the corn a mind of its own. ]]

For each human that the Temple 
brought to commune with it took only 
a small part of it with them and left 
only a small part in return. 

But the heart of the endless fields 
knew all about small things and 
how, in fertile soil, they would grow. 

Understanding is necessarily an 
exercise in sacrifice. When we learn 
more of others we 
submit some of ourselves. 


A woman's voice. Somehow he knew it 
was Bertholt's. 

Suddenly a sharp pain in his chest 
pulled his awareness, drifting 
among the many members of the field, 
suddenly back to his body and the heart 
above it. Gently, it pulled at a piece 
at him. Tenderly, it offered a piece 
of itself. 

At once he reached out to accept 
it, at once a boil of rage refused 
it. Another shock of pain rolled through 
him, defining arms, legs, chest 
against the advance of the heart. 

Sebastian came to his senses. 
This was the moment which would 
allow Freeman influence over him. 
Pain rolled through him like 
a trapped wave. He stopped trying to 
push through it and let it roll through 
him unencumbered. 

The heart quailed. It had no defense 
to such animal agony. Hastily, it withdrew 
its tendrils, offer rescinded. 

In his hands, the roots of the heart 
withered and turned to ash. 


Sebastian was sunk into 
his body. Pain, before abstract and 
distant, was now screaming 
from every nerve as he collapsed. 
Blood poured from every inch of his 
skin as new prophecies gleefully 
carved themselves into his flesh. 
His robes turned red with blood. 

Immediately there was chaos. 
Red robed figures ran to the heart's roots 
to assess the damage. Freeman 
was yelling. Sebastian heard him 
through a sick haze. 

"Sasha! I told you not to include 
him. You 
defied me and now look what you've 
done!"

A red robed figure quailed, it's hood 
had slipped off. Sasha. 

A curtain of red hung over his 
darkening vision. Sebastian 
forced his eyes upward. Erika, 
concern written over her face. He 
tried to reassure that he had succeeded, 
he had shaken off the field of corn, but 
no words came. Instead, from behind 
clenched teeth came a wordless 
groan, gasps of pain. 

Erika dropped down beside him and 
made as though to pick him up. Sebastian 
tried to reach out to her, but his hand 
closed on empty air. 

Freeman had yanked her back. In 
the quickly closing circle of vision, he 
could see his hand clasped tightly on 
her shoulder. 

"Did it work?" he was hissing. "Did he 
change?" His mouth was only inches 
from her ear. "Is he one of us?"

"Erika," he gasped silently. She [[ ? She could hear her, he knew. ]]

Freeman shook her shoulder 
forcefully. "Is he one of us?" he 
repeated more forcefully. 

There was something twisting in her 
face. She looked so strange. 


"No," said Erika. "He is not one of us." 

Her word were dim, as if spoken 
from [[some]] dark, fogged distance. Sebastian's 
vision faded to black. He lost 
consciousness. 

---

Sebastian emerged from unconsciousness, 
saw that he was in his cell and 
let sleep take him again. 

Eventually though, he could take no more 
refuge in sleep and opened 
his eyes to the half dark of his cell. 
His entire body seemed to protest its 
entire existence. Sebastian wasn't 
sure he could name a single part that 
didn't feel sore. Somehow the ache 
seemed worse than when he had 
been shot. 

He knew that sitting up would bring 
nothing but agony, but if he laid there 
too long, eventually he would have 
to address thoughts of his last few 
moments of consciousness. And he wasn't 
ready to face that yet. 

It took several false starts. 
No matter how he tried, he couldn't
persuade his muscles to contract through 
the onslaught of pain. Eventually 
he succeeded in half rolling, half 
falling off the bed. 

The impact against the floor sent 
spots in his vision. It took Sebastian 
several moments to catch his breath 
and clear the tears from his eyes. 

Once his heart had slowed again, 
he took stock of the sad state of his 
body. 
The nurses had 
seemed fit to bandage him more or less like 
a mummy, though his attempts to get 
out of bed had unraveled them in some 
places. The burst of pain in the 
underground seemed to have reopened 
old wounds, some long since healed, 
in addition to writing new ones. 
It was hard to say how many---
whole swathes of his body seemed to 
be one big ball of ache. Maybe 
later, when moving was less of a challenge, 
he'd find out what they said. 

So, then, there was nothing else left to 
think of but those last few moments 
before he had passed out. 
There was heartache. Sebastian could 
it feel it teetering on the edge of 
anger. He had been so close---gone 
through the cult's nonsense, faced 
the heart of the cornfields---and 
she had torn it all out beneath 
him. Now he had spilt all this blood 
and there was nothing to show for it. 
He was still a prisoner. 

But Sebastian held the anger 
back. After all, he had known that 
this would happen: On his left thing, 
Black Daphne commits the first 
betrayal oozed into its bandages

(( change the earlier prophecy 
to this))

And he remembered Freeman, hovering 
behind her. His hand, vice-like on her 
shoulder. The coldness in his face on hers. 
His thoughts louder than hers. 
Sebastian's skin 
crawled. Did she even have a choice?

In the end, he knew he wanted to forgive her. 
A small voice
pointed out the obvious: she shot you, 
she sold you out, if it weren't for 
her you would be free. But even so, 
Sebastian couldn't find it in him to hate 
her. 

(( all this is too tell not show-y ))

But why? She wasn't conventionally 
attractive--stocky and well-built, 
about as feminine as any of the 
mercenaries she worked with. Sebastian 
had had a handful of girlfriends before 
the Auguring had started, an 
age ago. They were all pretty much 
opposite to her in every way. 

In the end, he decided it was because 
she had treated him as another person. 
After years as a zoo exhibit, 
having 
someone to talk to made him feel 
human again. He had started to believe 
them, that he was little more than 
a prize to be jockeyed over. When 
he was around her, he felt real again. 

---

Sebastian awoke suddenly.
He had had a dream. He could remember 
it.
 
White walls, hardwood floors. Like 
some sort of modern art museum. At 
the center---something. He had seen 
it in his dream, but obscured 
by its forms other than the 
physical. Feathers, he remembered. 
Teeth. Unblinking reptilian eyes. 

He jumped out of bed, ignoring the 
protests of his body. He'd probably 
regret it later. But the winged, 
toothed thing, he knew of it from 
some prophecy before. He scrabbled at his 
bandages, trying to find it. 

There. On the back of his left arm. Scales, god touched, stolen 
from the dead, sleeps for three days. 

No, that wasn't it. There was 
another. Sebastian pulled off his shirt 
and ran his hands along his back, 
pulling away thick wads [[of gauze from his back]]. 
In the mirror he scanned 
his skin for signs of it. Something 
about feathers...


Only the light hearted may give 
winged judgment flight. 

Immediately Sebastian knew that the 
prophecy referred to the 
artifact of his dream. Even though it was 
just more nonsense when it had appeared 
several weeks ago. Something had changed.

There had been more. Over the 
last five years there had been 
so many. Sebastian had forgotten most 
of them--he'd never thought they 
would ever make sense to him. But now...

He needed a pen. And paper. But there 
was nothing to write with. There 
was always his blood and the walls, but 
he wasn't quite ready to stoop so low...

The door to his cell opened. Perfect 
timing. Sebastian walked up to the bars 
of his cell. 

"Do you have a pen on you---"

His guard wasn't alone. Melissa stepped 
from behind him. The words died in 
his throat. 

"Uh, yeah," she said, pulling one
from her pocket. She handed it over 
to him. "Um, it's nice to see you again."

(( might switch Michelle's gender))

(( make him / her more of a ex? junkie ))

Her eyes shifted down to Sebastian's 
chest, then the room behind him. 
Sebastian looked down. 
His shirt 
and bandages were scattered on the 
ground behind him. On his bare chest, 
some of the wounds had 
begun to bleed. 

"Er, you, too."

Michelle tore her eyes away from 
the cuts on his chest. 

"Sorry, they said I could come see you, 
but if you're busy--"

"No. I'm not busy. I mean, there's 
not much to do in... a... cell." Sebastian 
faltered. He tried again. "Did 
you decide to stay at the Temple?" 

Michelle nodded. "They have 
me doing logistics. Coordinating people, 
organizing social programs, stuff 
like that."

"What about your research?" Sebastian asked. 

"Oh. I'll send my notes to my 
colleagues. They'll incorporate them 
into their own reports. With some 
luck they'll give me some authorship." 
She laughed hollowly. "Though to be 
honest, publishing and tenure 
and all that, it doesn't seem so 
important any more."

"Oh."

"Well, I just wanted to make sure 
you were alright, after..."

"Yeah," Sebastian said. "Just a little 
sore. [[ happens all the time ]]"

"Oh. That's good." 

She shied away awkward, about to 
excuse herself. 

"Wait. Before you go, what happened, 
after I passed out?"

(( maybe she has some rank, wearing something weird. ))

"Not too much. Master Freeman 
stormed out. He took Sasha with him. 
The ______ took us back to the [[surface]]
They carried you out. The heart was alright 
as well. 

"What about the woman, in red 
robes with dark hair?"

Michelle furrowed her brown. "
You mean Freeman's 
informer?"

Sebastian's heart sank. "I guess I do."

"She left Freeman and Sasha," she 
said. But maybe seeing the way his face 
fell, she added. "But she made sure you 
were taken care of." 

"I see," he said. "Thank you, Michelle. 
For everything, and the pen."

"You're welcome, I guess. Will I see 
you around?"

"You know where I am," he said. 

Michelle excused herself. The guard 
escorted her out, shutting the door behind 
him. Sebastian waited for their footsteps 
to abate before retreating to the back 
of his cell. 

As he did, he caught a glance of 
himself in the mirror. 

His immediate reaction was
to look 
away, but this time 
he couldn't. The wounds 
traced themselves thickly over his skin, 
like lace. The skin between them 
was pink and swollen. 

Is this what Michelle saw when 
she spoke to him? 

Suddenly he understood her nervousness. 
Sebastian had felt 
the discomfort himself, 
interacting with the ill, the insane, 
or the impoverish[ed]. A combination of 
pity and guilt. 

Sebastian put it from his mind. One 
day the cuts would heal, one day the 
ache would fade. One day Michelle 
would forget about him and he would 
forget about her. In the meanwhile, 
maybe he could make sense of the 
past five years of suffering.

(( Some excerpts of cult doctrines ))

The... organ we have found at the 
center of the cornfield exhibits strange 
behavior when exposed to various 
chemical signals. Spectroscopy 
of its root system with 
heavy water reveals patterns never 
seen before. Kent wasn't sure 
it was even physically possible. 

The mystery deepened when we showed 
the photos to local farmers, who 
immediately recognized local features: 
rivers, hills, even patches 
where the fields had been struck by 
lightning and the crops had burned. 

We quickly enlisted their help, 
paying to thresh a section of the crop 
early. Even before they could notify us 
that they had done so we saw a change 
in the chemical response. Nutrient 
absorption in the corresponding section 

[[ add in dates ]]
of the root system decreased by approximately 
40%. There was no question that 
the death of the crops was the cause. 
Kent insisted on verifying. All 
experiments resulted in the same 
outcome. 

We have not yet discovered the 
mechanism of communication between 
the heart and the fields. It is not 
impossible that the root system around 
it is eventually connected to the 
field's as a whole, though this is not 
typical for corn plants. But even if it 
was[[were]], there is no way any sort of 
chemical signal can be transmitted 
across such great distances so quickly. 
That leaves only electrical 
or radiation-based communication, but 
we have detected no such signals. 
I feel something beyond our current 
scientific understanding is at work, 
perhaps something beyond science itself. 
Kent thinks I am being ridiculous,
but as he repeats the same experiments 
again and again, he is coming to 
realize that my conclusion is the only one that can be drawn. 

---

Marcus flew into a rage today. He is 
saying that we, Kent and I and the other 
researchers, have changed. That working 
with the heart has made us different 
somehow. He could not tell me how or 
why, but he has threatened to take 
our children and bring them home. I 
tried to reason with him but he was 
adamant. He says that on Sunday he'll 
be leaving, with or without me.

In brighter news, Kent has 
come around, and now acknowledges that 
we have ventured into territory wholly 
unknown. He has taken [[to]] the task of 
mapping it with great fervor. Lately 
he has taken to saying 'since we 
have no hope of understanding its 
mechanisms, we must endeavor to 
understand the heart itself.' He is looking 
for some way to communicate with it. 
I have something in mind, but perhaps 
communicating is not the right word for it. 

I can tell Marcus is serious about 
his threat to leave. The last thing 
I want is to leave my work, but 
I can't bear to be away from 
Maria [[Maya]] and little Sasha. If they go, 
I must go with them. Freeman [[ Kent ]] will 
have to manage without me.

It's strange. Prior to all 
this, when we first arrived here, if 
Marcus had proposed that he and the 
kids return home, I would have had 
no problem staying behind. But now, 
even the thought seems unbearable. 
Paradoxically, the more I am entrenched 
in my work, the stronger I feel the 
impetus to leave it. But stronger, too, grows 
my sadness to leave it behind. 

--- 
((maybe F. just tells her he left)) [[nah.]]

Marcus is dead. Kent found him, 
cold, in the chamber of the heart. 
There were no marks on him. I do 
not know what took him from me.
Perhaps Kent knows, but if he does, 
he will not say. 

We buried Marcus in the fields. 
His grave is marked with a small 
stone. Brother planted the 
seed of an oak beside the headstone. 
If the heart wills it, it will grow into 
a mighty tree. 

Sasha and Maria cried for their 
father. Almost more so than Marcus's 
death, their sadness breaks my heart. 
I do not know which is worse, Maria's 
attempts to remain strong through her 
tears or Sasha's despair filled 
confusion. 

To distract myself from grief, from 
thinking of my memories of Marcus and the 
life I might have lived with him, I have 
thrown myself into my work. It feels so 
wrong to leave my children, but their 
faces, they look, act, speak so much 
like their father. Kent has been such 
a blessing, handling the
monumental task of both organizing this 
expedition and comforting two grieving 
children. I asked them if they wanted 
to return to their home in Middleton, 
but they didn't want to leave their uncle. 
Their love for him is one of the 
few comforts in this trying time. 

Enough of this sadness. The sooner I 
can heal from this, the sooner I can be 
there for my children and the sooner I 
can resume my duties to the expedition. 
Kent is still pushing forward through this 
tragedy. He has taken my suggestion [[ and  ]] hired a genetic 
engineer to come on to examine the 
symbiotic bacteria of the roots. Perhaps 
some can be engineered to be sympathetic 
with our own nervous systems. 

---

My mind dwells on Marcus often. To be 
expected. Now that the shock has abated, 
regret fills my mind instead. His last words 
to me.... that I had 
changed, that I seemed almost a stranger, 
maybe they were true. 

[[ Maybe make some more dramatic change; she points out she's still there for her kids as a defense, but Marcus points out that this isn't reassuring---before she was a role model for them, now she cares more about her duties to them ]]

Mostly I feel like myself. Kent 
and the others agree. I would 
ask my children, but confusing 
questions will not help them heal. 
Comparing my writings now 
are comparable to when we first 
arrived, though grief does change us. 

But there are strange discrepancies. 
I have sacrificed family for 
my career in the past---with Marcus's 
blessing---but was willing to return home 
at the cost of the discovery of a life 
time. The time I once spent on myself, 
reading or drawing, I now spend with 
my children or the expedition. 
Some of it is to make up for the hole 
Marcus has left, but even before that. 
Maybe it was just my motherly 
instincts waxing as they do as I age, 
maybe just my passion for this new 
project. But even now, knowing it 
would do me good, I cannot bring 
myself to take some time to myself. 
Maybe it is grief, maybe it is not.

Because the heart is the nexus of 
a great system. A system of a hundred 
thousand living things, each striving to 
maximize its individual success. In this 
striving they ensure the success of 
the ecosystem as a whole. But enter 
humans, who defy this formula. We make 
choices that benefit no one, not even 
themselves [[ourselves ]]. Pursuing wealth and fame 
over their families. Dedicating 
time to fleeting joys, like music or 
art. Expressing individuality for the 
sake of individuality, choosing 
freedom for the sake of freedom. 
As we interact with this ecosystem, with 
the heart itself, it must know that our 
consciousness is inefficiency, 
and inefficiency could destroy it. 
After all, its guidance has guarded 
the monoculture through drought and 
plague. As we become part of the 
ecosystem, it guides us towards systemic 
thoughts. Makes us love our families 
and communities. Minimizes our egos. 
Brings us back to simpler times. 

Because we do not know the method 
by which it is connected to the fields, 
we also cannot detect whether it has 
reached out to us. The bioengineer 
has created a bacteria that secretes 
a psychoactive substance that should 
allow them to commune with us. But 
I suspect we shall discover that 
it already has. 

[[ she should be not grieving as much as she would expect ]]

---

The bioengineer has succeeded. 
A week ago he completed the culture 
and introduction of his bacteria to 
the heart's roots. He volunteered himself 
to test the results. At first nothing, 
just the normal hallucinatory effects. 

(( they're originally ecologists, studying 
a particularly resilient cornfield ))

Dave didn't seem discouraged though. 

"Give them a week. That 
should give them a few thousand generations 
to adapt."

And sure enough, in two weeks time 
he tried again. The new high was 
short, nearly free of side effects. 
But Dave came out of it dazed. 
His life, he said, had been changed. 

Kent was hesitant, but I was not. 
Since my last account I had grown ever 
more certain that we were already 
part of the heart's domain. [[ It was time for a proper introduction to the master of this domain]]

We were wrong about the heart. It 
was not some brain behind the cornfield, 
nor some guardian spirit. 
It is the cornfield. 
And every plant, prey, predator, decomposer 
that touches the corn is the heart. The thing we found is 
little more than a physical manifestation 
of the unity that they have formed, like 
a wedding ring to a lifelong vow. No 
corn, no earthworm, no pollinator knows 
of this unity, yet it ties them together 
in their joint pursuit of ecology. 

And, we, too, are part of this 
ecology. When we 
leave footprints in the mud, pry the 
corn from their stalks, take shelter 
from the sun [[ in their shade]], we give some of our 
selves to the heart and the heart gives 
some of itself to us. When we introduce 
new genes to its symbiotes, when we 
touch it with bare skin [[and let them colonize our own microflora]], when we let it give us visions, 
we exchange bigger portions. We give 
it seed in our hearts. 

But this is not the ecosystem 
we are part of. [[ this is not our home ecosystem, or something ]] For the 
heart cannot understand 
our individuality, the higher 
thoughts that we consider to define us, 
though it tries. I theorize that some 
other heart must exist somewhere, that 
connects our true selves, in our 
self contradictions and self destruction and 
self absorption. But likely, it is nothing 
like the heart of these fields. It must take some other form, founded on some other 
tree of life. 


When I stood there, in the fields---as the 
fields, I felt a peace like I had never 
before. I was surprised how natural it 
felt, like I had been with them all along. 
In a way, I have. We have lived here 
nearly a year now. My children have 
grown here. My husband is buried here. 
If only, before he had died, he had 
been able to see what I 
had seen---had given a part of himself to 
the heart, as I have. Then, he would 
be with us, still. Kent, though, I will 
have forever, and when Sasha + Maria 
are older, I perhaps they will choose to 
join us as well. Then though death may 
take us one by one, we shall never be 
apart. 

--- 

GRIEF was too much for her. My beloved 
sister is gone. The world is bleak, empty. 
She left her children behind. She left me 
as well. 

I have pored over her notes, her reports, 
her journal, trying to understand why she left 
us. There is insight there,
wisdom, but none 
of it about herself. [[ but so sparingly about herself ]] It was very much 
like her. 

She is not dead, not yet. But I 
have told her children that she is gone. 
To give them hope, when there is none, 
would be too cruel. I allow myself [[this]] hope, 
and it tears me apart. 

I found her in the chamber of the 
heart, where Marcus lay [[laid]]. Its roots had 
grown round her. They traced her skin like 
fine lace. Her eyes were shut. She was 
breathing. But she would not wake. Not 
when we brought her to the surface, 
doused her with water, injected her with 
adrenaline. An EKG revealed no brain 
activity. She was already gone. But I know where. 

I went to the 
heart, let it whisper to me. 
She was there, but not all 
of her. Mother and wife and sister was there. 
Even scientist. But the essence of her, 
her laughter, he intelligence, 
her kindness, was not. Where had it 
gone? 


Then, in her journals, I found the answer. 
Amongst the grief stricken rambles was 
the insights of a scientist. There is 
nothing special about these fields 
save for their tenacity. That is how we 
found the heart. And what is more tenacious 
than humankind? Another heart exists---the 
human heart, connecting our consciousnesses 
across the globe. And that is where I 
will find her, [[there]] in that tree of life. 

[[Maybe Freeman still has her hooked up to life support somewhere, her consciousness could not be brought back from the heart like it could for animals and such; something is missing ]]

(( what happened to Maria? Went t
o work for the foundation? Maybe that's 
S's helpful foundation friend. ))

(( There are two kinds of people---the 
kind who want to live forever and those 
who wish they were dead. S is the former, 
E the latter ))

"Something's different, isn't it?"

[[ blah, the beginning of act 3 is terrible ]]

This time, when the dreamwalker 
found him, Sebastian was waiting 
for him at the stone gate.The wind had died down to a breeze. 
But the stone was still cold and bit 
to touch at his skin. Sebastian 
stood before the stone gate, looking up at it. 
The urge to force it open was still there, 
but he could hold it at bay.

The door was open, just wide enough 
for a single finger. 
Sebastian turned to face the 
dreamwalker, where she sat on a fallen 
tree in the midst of the beginning of 
an old glade. This time she wore 
Michelle's face. 

"I've started remembering my dreams," 
he said. "It makes sense now, why I was 
so tired, no matter how much 
I slept. I barely got any rest at all." 

"It's a part of coming into your 
own," the dreamwalker said. "Things 
will change quickly for you now."

"Why?" Sebastian asked. His hand 
was still on the gate, though the touch 
chilled him to the bone. He couldn't 
yet bring himself to let go of it. "What 
am I becoming?"

"I don't now their true names, but 
in the language of my people, we might 
have called them Devas. But they are not 
gods, nor angels, nor demons. They're 
something both more and less than that. 
They deal in fate---in future and past, 
what is written to happen. Your dreams 
and your wounds are a part of that."

"The name, Augur," Sebastian said. 
"Dr. Bedlam gave it to me ironically. 
Because I insisted that I wasn't a 
prophet---I wasn't cutting 
myself. But it's true now, I can 
know the future."

The dreamwalker gave a wary 
glance at the gate. "I would be 
cautious, though. There are many 
who have inherited the powers of the 
deva. It always comes at a cost. Blindness, 
madness, lameness. That you seem to 
have escaped these should be a cause for 
concern, not celebration."

Sebastian looked up at the gate and 
the featureless sky above. 
"I think I've paid enough already. It's 
probably time to start reaping the rewards." 

--- 
[[ I suspect this section is supposed to be deleted... ]]

Sebastian woke to a rattling knock. 
As he rubbed the sleep from his eyes, 
they entered his cell and began the 
process of photographing his wounds and changing his bandages---
these days a task which took nearly 
an hour. 

Sebastian was in the habit of staring 
blankly in the wall during the process, 
trying to pass through the block of time with 
as little presence as possible. Today, though, 
he couldn't help over hearing them complain 
that all this was a waste of time---
they'd be doing 
it all over again this afternoon
after Master Freeman was done with him
 [[ yup, it was deleted]]
---

"You requested an audience with me?" 

"Yes, Master Freeman," said Sebastian,
bowing his head respectfully. 

Under armed guard, Sebastian had 
been brought to Freeman's 
chambers. Several days ago he had 
knocked on the door to his cell, 
saying he had something of vital importance 
to tell the leader of the temple. The 
guards hadn't taken him seriously at 
first---dismissing his words as the 
pleading of the mad. Eventually, though, 
it had reached 
one of the 
few mercenaries who had initiated 
into the cult, who was more inclined to 
believe Sebastian's claims of knowing 
the future. 

At long last, Sebastian 
was in Freeman's chambers, standing 
amongst his other treasures in the half 
dark. When he had stood here for the 
first time---almost a year ago, 
Sebastian realized---Freeman's collection 
had seemed magpie-like, full of 
indiscriminate treasures. Now, though, 
he could see the obsession was more 
focused. Scrolls of calligraphy over
laid by curling drawings of a human
brain. Sculptures depicting human forms 
curving and curling into one another, 
or into the shapes of animals or 
trees. He, too, Sebastian realized, was 
a part of this [[curated]] collection. And Erika 
as well. 

Speaking of Erika, Sebastian looked 
around the room for her. He was almost 
surprised to find her, sulking half hidden 
behind a folding screen decorated with 
brain-like clouds. He wouldn't have 
thought Freeman would let her 
into his inner sanctum. [[ Then why is he looking? ]]

"You attempted to join us---to 
infiltrate us recently, did you not?" 
Freeman said, pacing. "I instructed 
Sasha not to extend the invitation to 
you, but he did so anyways. I knew that 
your motivation would not be to 
accomplish our goal for unified consciousness 
but just for freedom. And though such 
things can be compensated for---we 
did not know how the heart would react 
to you. And my fears, in the end
were well-founded. You[[emph]] were not converted 
and Sasha's actions almost caused the 
heart irreparable harm."

Sebastian quickly looked around the 
room for Sasha but did not see him. 
Normally it seemed he followed Freeman 
around like a shadow. 

"Both my disappointment and yours, Master," 
said Sebastian. 

There was a flicker of surprise on Freeman's 
face. 

"So you do wish to serve the Temple's cause." 

Sebastian lowered his gaze. "Yes, though 
the heart did ultimately reject me, 
I still saw the endless fields. I wish to 
aid the cult in the only way that I can."

"Then those prophecies---the latest, of 
the great tree? Do you know their meaning?"

Freeman's voice was a passioned whisper. 
His eyes were wide with anticipation. 
Sebastian felt said prophecies itch 
under his clothes.
"No. I don't know what they mean. Not 
yet."

((got to actually write what they are)) 

Freeman spun around in disgust. 

"This has been a waste of 
my time. Take him back--"

"Wait!" Sebastian interrupted. 
"I don't know the meaning of these 
prophecies, but when I communed 
with the heart, I 
learned other things."

Slowly Freeman turned back around. 
Sebastian continued. 

"It's an artifact, given by gods to 
the kings of men. They used it to enforce 
order among their followers." 

"The heart of these fields does more than 
enough to ensure loyalty to my cause."

He turned away again. 


"But you still have traitors," Sebastian 
cut in before he give the order 
to return him to his cell. "Before the 
heart can take hold of them. This will 
kill them." 

Freeman turned slowly back towards 
him. 

"And you can be assured of this?" he 
said, slowly. 

"It's written into my skin," said Sebastian. 

He drew back his sleeve. A fresh 
wound was there, ugly with scabs, but 
still readable. 

"Hungrily, it shall consume betraying 
hearts." 

Freeman stared at his arm with 
intensity. Sebastian held still against it, 
heart thumping as he scrutinized the 
wound. 

"Very well then. Do you know the location?" 

"Yes," said Sebastian. "And I've 
been inside the walls of the facility, in my 
dreams."

"Then I will ready an operation
for you. Be prepared to leave within 
the week."

---

The guards let Sebastian back 
into his cell. He quickly collapsed 
into his bed. He shut 
his eyes, exhausted. 

A week, then. He had until then 
to try and transfer what he could 
remember of his dreams to his 
waking mind. In his dreams he 
could remember the way there, 
the patrols of the guards, the dangers 
he had avoided, but such 
dream memories always 
faded quickly upon waking. In the morning 
he would ask for a map and try and 
retrace his steps. There were only so 
many places such an artifact could be 
found. 

The door to his cell opened. Sebastian 
opened his eyes, but before he could 
react, Erika had him pressed 
against the wall of his cell. 

"What are you planning?" she demanded. 

Her face was only inches from his, 
scowling impressively. Sebastian thrashed 
as he fought to inhale against the weight 
of her against him. Seeing him struggle, 
she let up a little. 

"You forgot those ridiculous robes 
of yours," he wheezed out. 

Apparently she didn't appreciate the 
comment and squeezed emphatically back 
down on him. "What are you planning?" 
she repeated. 

Erika's eyes were dark and unreadable. 

"Who's asking? Is it Freeman's informant 
or is it you?" he said. 

She let him go. Sebastian collapsed 
ungracefully against the wall. 
Erika watched as he picked himself up off 
the floor. 

"I can make you tell me," she said 
darkly [[?]]. She pulled off her gloves for emphasis. 

"You would do that, for Freeman?" 
said Sebastian. "Though I suppose you're 
doing that already, subverting your sense 
of self for his benefit."

Erika's expression didn't change. 
"I can tell you're planning something. 
All that about serving the temple was 
a lie." 

"Have you told Freeman yet?" he asked. 

"No."

"Why not?" 

Sebastian smiled humorlessly as Erika 
failed to give an answer. She scowled.

"You know exactly why not."

"We can't all be mind readers, Erika. 
You sold me out at the initiation. 
Why not do it again?"

"Because Freeman's 
not here this time," she said, quietly. 

[[ do you want in? ]]

"He's not here now either," he said. 
"Just so you know, I do have a plan. 
But I don't intend to tell you." 

[[ Feel free to tell Freeman. But this time do it sooner than later, so I don't get my hopes up. ]]
Erika heaved out a sigh, as if whatever 
force had carried her here had suddenly 
abandoned her. 

"It's probably for the best," she said. [[ I won't tell Freeman. Not yet, at least. ]]

Sebastian looked at her carefully. There 
were deep bags under her eyes. Her hair, 
usually pulled behind her into a severe 
ponytail was beginning to slip into fly 
aways. There was a slouch to her posture 
she couldn't seem to shake. 

"You can't---"

"I'll be---"

They both tried to speak at the same 
time. 

"No, nevermind," Sebastian said. "You 
were saying."

"I'll be going with you, on Thursday," 
she said. 

"To make sure everything goes 
according to plan?"

She smiled reluctantly. "More or less. What 
were you going to say?"

"I'll tell you later," he said.

---

At the center of the dream, Sebastian 
and the artifact, winged, toothed, many eyed. 
Sebastian watched it warily. It was 
dangerous---equal parts 
zealous order and ravenous hunger. [[righteousness]]

In the dream, Sebastian tiptoed 
carefully from the room. Its hungry eyes 
followed him outward, but let him leave. 

Free from the strange alien gaze of 
the artifact, Sebastian tried to remember 
how he had arrived here. He had come 
through a labyrinth of white walls. There 
had been guards, and other dangers, but 
the details were lost to him. Before 
that they had driven for three

[[ change it so that Sebastian insists on coming with them to an existing raid, Freeman is surprised that he knows of it; maybe they don't realize the gallery is foundation funded ]]
days, stopping for the night at tiny motels. 
They drove away from the sun in the morning, 
into it in the afternoon, through hot 
desert and orange sands, over 
shrubland mountains and dust roads...

Sebastian stretched and pulled at his 
fragile dream memory, hoping for 
signage and the names of towns and roads, 
but they were just a blur to him. Instead, 
a flash of memory---an emblem. He'd 
seen it before, he would see it again, but 
in the dream it evaded his memory. 

In the morning, he would meet with 
the Temple's organizers, and piece together 
the flashes of his memory to a sensible 
plan. The vagueness of what he 
remembered would frustrate them, but the 
emblem, hastily reproduced would solve 
the mystery. 

A thrashing from the winged thing's room 
drew Sebastian back towards it. He still could 
not see it directly, disguising itself from him 
in auras of feathers and gnashing teeth. 
Its dual nature warred with itself 
hatefully, but both sides called out to him 
impatient, for sinners to condemn to 
death, for hearts to feed to hungry jaws.

The winged teethed thing shuddered, 
extending its tendrils of feathers and 
spines outwards, snaking outward, into 
the halls outside the room. Sebastian stepped 
back as it reached toward him.

The hearts of the innocent, let 
them float free. The hearts of 
the guilty, let their heavy flesh 
fall to my waiting teeth...

[[ it floods the room, the sinners sink, the innocent rise... ]]

It was here, he realized, in his 
dream. It had broken free from his memory 
of the future, and it knew he was coming 
to it. 

"What have I gotten myself into?" 

Those were the words followed him on his lips when 
he awoke in the morning. 

---


Early in the morning, they 
packed him and a week's worth 
of supplies into the back of two vans 
along with a team of six. As Sebastian 
clambered into what was indicated 
to be his seat, he felt a wave of 
deja vu wash through him. [[ maybe his blood stains are still in this particular van ]] 
At least they wouldn't be 
putting a bag over his head this time. 

As the sun began to rise and preparations 
began to wrap up, Sebastian began to 
look around nervously. Where was Erika? 
Somehow the thought of leaving 
without her made his guts begin 
to twist with anxiety...

There she was. At the last moment, 
she climbed into the van, flopped into 
the seat beside him, and promptly 
fell asleep. [[ she should be blasting music into her ears to drown out the others' thoughts; also, people are uncomfortable having her nearby. ]]

So then all eight of them were present 
and accounted for. They pulled out from 
the small lot of vans and out past 
the concrete walls of the 
compound and onto the open road.
"The Foundation bastards again?"

The man in the passenger's seat 
muttered to the driver. 

"Yeah," she responded. "Their 
place out in the desert. Remember last time we 
were there?"

"Yeah. We got shot to shit."

The driver took her eyes off the 
road for a moment, meeting 
Sebastian's in the mirror. "This time 
it's supposed to be different."

[[this should be in reference to them essentially trading him for information about the tree ]] 

Sebastian didn't respond. He looked 
away to the landscape passing outside. 
The feeling of deja vu hadn't 
fully left from the morning, though 
it was hard to say whether it just 
from being out in the cornfields or 
from the memories of his dreams.

(( though I never established how S. knew 
his dreams were true. Maybe need an 
episode about that? ))

Beside him Erika slept like the dead. 
Nervous energy and excitement 
to at last be out of his cell prevented him 
from doing the same. Instead, he 
fixed his nervous energy 
on the pillars of clouds rising like mountains 
in the distance.

Eventually, though, he should fall asleep, 
and try and retrieve something more from 
his dreams.

--- 

(( Maybe now would be a good time for 
the conversation w/ the dreamwalkers? ))

As the day grew longer, and the 
air hot and drier, Sebastian began 
to drowse. Poor sleep kept him drifting 
between dreamless sleep and half 
remembered flashes of confusing images. 

The drivers, too, grew tired. They stopped 
twice to switch, Erika taking the last 
shift as the sun began to set. 
Before long, it grew 
dark over the desert. 

"They're asleep," said Erika, from the 
driver's seat. 

"I was about to ask," said Sebastian, 
opening his eyes, done pretending to 
sleep. 

"Yeah," she said, not taking her eyes 
off the road. "Though 
we'll be at the next town in a few minutes. 
Thompson'll probably radio in to say we're 
stopping for the night soon." 

"Oh."

"Did you think we'd chat the night 
away?"

"Maybe a little," Sebastian admitted. 

Silence fell over them. 
Sebastian pretended to be interested in 
something invisible in the dark. 

"Since the initiation, have you been 
okay?" she asked hesitantly. 


"I could ask you the same," said Sebastian. 
"You stopped visiting. Were you busy?" 

Erika's grip tightened on the steering 
wheel. "Yeah. Since he found that 
one traitor, he's been convinced there 
are more. He hasn't let me out of his 
sight, for the past few weeks." 

"And that's your reason for being such 
an an unadulterated bitch since then?" 

Erika flinched. The van swerved 
just the slightest amount.

"Yes. No. I guess it's more 
than that. If it means anything to you, I 
felt like shit about it afterwards. Both 
the initiation and last week, in 
the cell. I spent all week 
trying to force myself to go in there and 
apologize, but then Freeman gets a 
whiff of disloyalty and I run in there 
without a question [[ like his dog ]]. Couldn't bare to look 
you in the eye after all that. I still can't."

After a moment, the radio 
buzzed on with a storm of static. Through
it they could make out the name 
of a hotel and fragments of an 
address from the other car. Moments 
later, the lights of a tiny town 
came into view. A row of houses, 
a dust-colored diner. A gas station, 
and a three room hotel. The 
other van was already parked 
outside. 

"But yeah," Sebastian said, as the 
other two in the van were beginning to 
stir as Erika slowed down. 

"Yeah what?" Erika asked, though 
she watched her colleagues warily 
as they woke. 

"I've been fine, since then. Could have been 
better, but I'm fine."

---

To arrive at the Gallery after 
dark, they had some time to kill. One 
of the men had taken that as permission 
to buy an armful of beers by banging 
on the general store until its 
owner came down the street to 
oblige him business. Soon enough
they had a fire going in the dirt of 
the motel's parking lot. 

Sebastian watched them from 
where he sat in the 
open door of the van. Erika had 
made a big show of intimidating 
him into not trying to make 
a break for it. Hard to say whether 
she meant it or not, but seeing 
her laugh and laze about with 
the other mercenaries, she probably 
did. 

Interestingly, though he 
hadn't seen her drink, she seemed 
to get progressively tipsier, if not 
in coordination, then in general mood. 
Currently she was leaning back against 
a pile of duffel bags 
with an 
absent smile on her face, presumably 
looking up at the stars. 

[[ it's a little pathetic to watch her adopt their mood while they outwardly attempt to reject her ]]

Sebastian did the same. The 
huge band of the milky way glittered 
undiluted by earthly lights. If his 
life had taken the course he had 
planned for it he'd likely would never 
have seen such a sight. He wasn't quite sure what to think of it. 

Some sort of ruckus directed his 
attention back to the ground. Freddy, 
the newest to the group, from what 
Sebastian could tell, was being egged 
on to do some task. Mick and 
Sean, since troublemakers 
always ran in pairs, 
were attempting to persuade him 
to do something he likely shouldn't. 
Calvin was 
goading him on, though mostly out 
of desperation to gain Sean + Mick's 
approval. Thompson, a humorless ex 
cop watched on with disapproval, but 
not enough to stop it. Irene looked 
more inclined to step in, but wasn't likely 
to rock the boat. 

Freddy was persuaded. Only a little 
unsteadily he crossed the fire, where 
Erika was still looking up at the stars, 
drunk off their good humor. Sebastian 
started cringing in advance. 

Freddy started on some 
winding ramble. Erika at least 
bothered to pull herself upright to listen 
to what he was saying. Judging by her 
contortions of confusion, not much of it 
made sense. Sebastian couldn't hear 
what they were saying, but he had 
a feeling that perhaps it was a poor 
attempt at a come-on. 

After a moment, Erika rebuffed him with 
a lazy wave of dismissal. She 
started to flop backwards again, to her 
old star gazing position, but Freddie 
made a swipe towards the only bit of 
exposed skin, at her face. [[ maybe tried to kiss her or something? ]]

With one fluid movement, she had him on 
the ground, twisting his arm behind him, 
knee into his back. Mick, Sean and 
Calvin broke into guffaws. Even 
Thompson couldn't suppress a single 
bark of laughter. 

Erika let go of him with a huff of disgust. 
She stormed over to Sebastian, all
earlier levity gone. 

"Your bandages need to be changed. 
Come inside. Then I'm going to sleep."

Sebastian jumped out of her way as 
she barged past him to fetch her 
things from the van. She grabbed 
a duffel bag under each arm and 
took them with her into the motel. 

[[ Maybe some obnoxious quip from Calvin? 'have fun together freaks' sort of thing? ]]

Sebastian glanced back at the 
rest of the group before following 
her inside. They didn't seem 
to particularly care they were gone. 
Mick + Sean were patting Freddy 
on the back, giving more ill advice. 
Thompson + Irene were engaged in 
some more serious conversation, as 
if they had never been there at all. 

"Coming?" Erika grumbled from 
the door. Sebastian nodded and hurried 
inside. 

The less said about the interior of 
the room the better. Sebastian tried 
to guess the decade the
decor had last been updated, but 
doing so required looking far too 
closely at the room's grimy fixtures.

The sole lighting was a dim lamp by the 
bed side. Sebastian did his best to 
adjust the lampshade to get some better 
light while Erika rummaged through 
the bags for medical supplies. 

Sebastian pulled off his shirt, wincing 
as it tugged at the gauze of the bandages. 
Though most of the lacerations from 
the initiation had closed, new 
prophecies written over them dredged 
up old aches and irritation. 

"What?" Sebastian asked. Erika 
had found the bandages and had stopped, staring 
at him. 

"At the initiation, what happened?" 
she asked. 

"You were there, too, weren't you?" 

"Yes, but, I wasn't [[??]] 
it all happened so 
quickly. Why did it hurt you so badly?"


Sebastian looked down at the cuts 
criss crossing his arms and chests. [[ chest ]]

"I'm not sure," he said. "I don't 
think it was the heart," he said. 
"Something else did this, and drove 
the heart away."

[[ In the revised version, he sees the future with Erika dying, lies about it ]]

"Something's different about you, 
too," said Erika. "Not the way 
that the others were different, 
after the initiation. But 
still different, somehow." 

"You noticed it too?" Sebastian tried to 
keep his voice calm, but knew that 
he couldn't keep the swimming feeling 
of uncertainty from her. What is 
happening to me? 

[[ Don't really like the line of dialogue, but I do like that she can tell his uncertainty ]]

Erika gently sat him down on the 
bed and started to peel the gauze 
from his back. 

"It's probably nothing," she said. 
"We all change sometimes."

Changing his bandages was a 
lengthy process, and they spoke little 
while they worked. Erika addressed 
what parts Sebastian needed help with 
and then left the rest to him while 
she got ready for bed. Just as he 
was finishing up, she pulled 
apart the stiff covers of the bed 
and settled into sleep, still fully clothed. 

Sebastian hesitated at the edge [[of the]]bed. 
The mattress was plenty big for both 
of them---was the intention that 
they would share? 

There was a knock at the door. 
Before Sebastian could respond, Erika 
was out of bed and headed over to 
the door. She opened it a crack. 

It was Freddy. 

"Uh, Erika, I---I'm sorry about."

Sebastian could just hear them over 
the howl of the room's dying air 
conditioner. 

"Don't worry about it," he heard 
her say softly. "They do it with 
all the new recruits. I shouldn't 
have taken it out on you." 

Even through the tiny crack in 
the door, Freddy looked visibly 
relieved. 

"Yeah, it's uh, no problem. 
Just don't hold it against me 
tomorrow." 

Freddy disappeared with a 
fading nervous laugh. Erika shut 
the door and made her way back 
to the bed. 

"You know, I've said it before, 
but you're like a completely different 
person, sometimes."

"You caught me in a good mood," 
she said. "Since Freeman's not around." 
She climbed back into bed. "Now 
get in bed and go to sleep. I won't 
be able to fall asleep with you 
standing there fretting about 
impropriety or something British 
like that." 


Sebastian laughed. "That's 
rich, coming from a yank who goes 
red if as I as much as take off 
my shirt." 

Erika grumbled and rolled away from 
him under the covers. Sebastian 
snickered and obligingly slid under 
the covers. 

Though the mattress was more spring 
than soft, Sebastian felt his limbs 
immediately give in, suddenly as 
heavy as lead. Despite the strange 
smells of the room and the roar of 
the air conditioner, he was sure that 
in moments he would be asleep. 

And so he was. 

---

They had a late start to arrive after 
dark. Sebastian slept through most of it, 
while the others spent the time checking 
weapons and other equipment in 
preparation. Around 9 o clock someone 
knocked on the door to leave him 
breakfast. Sebastian woke and had 
a leisurely breakfast. A phone check 
in with headquarters later, and they 
were back on the road. 

Sebastian had taken the 
pen and paper from the hotel 
room, trying to write down what 
he remembered of his dream. Though 
he had dreamt of the 
artifact last night, it was 
confounded with other visions---
fields of corn, dark labyrinths, 
a giant leafless tree.

He tried to focus on the practical 
fragments---where had they 
entered from, where they had left. 
When and where had they encountered 
guards---how those conflicts had 
ended. The more he wrote, the 
more seemed to emerge from 
his memory. 

But how could he know that it was all true? 
Of some things there was no doubt---of 
the artifact's existence, that they 
would need to spill blood to achieve 
it. But the other details? Hazy, like 
grasping at fog. 

Erika looked over to his disorganized 
scrawl. She watched him write for 
a while, but he doubted she could 
read anything. 

"Don't stress about it," she said. 
"We're all professionals at this." [[ we've done this before ]]

---

[[ As the sun was setting, they turned off the highway and began to drive through the desert on a dusty road barely distinguished the from sand around them. They shut off the radio. Though it was quickly growing darker, they turned off their headlights.  What light chatter there fell to a tense silence. ]]
[[ There was the slightest of inclines. Gradually the terrain grew rockier and treacherous. A short buzz on the radio from the other car and they came to a halt. Without speaking, the team left their vehicles, grabbing supplies from the back of the trucks and continuing the climb on foot. 

Moonlight provided enough light to see by, but it took the full of Sebastian's attention to avoid losing his footing over the uneven ground. The jagged stones were still warm from the heat of the day, though the temperature was rapidly dropping. Sebastian was glad they had not asked him to carry anything. Spending several years in a cell had done little for his physical fitness, and it took all his effort just to keep up with the others. ]]
[[ The incline crested and fell to a sharp cliff. At its base was their destination: the Gallery. 

The Foundation, the Temple's logistics team had explained to him, had several facilities, necessary to house the wealth of anomalies they had collected. New facilities sprung up where certain anomalies could not be easily moved, but still needed to be contained. Site 183, known commonly as the Gallery, was one such facility. But unconventional, even by Foundation standards. Most of their sites followed a standard layout, sized appropriately. The gallery did not. But it worked out in their favor, they assured the team. ]]
At sundown, a lone vehicle made 
its way down the road in a cloud of 
dust. It stopped outside the baked 
concrete walls, where a guard 
armed with an automatic rifle 
held them outside the gate. The 
window rolled down, words were 
exchanged, the van continued. 

Within the exterior of concrete 
walls and barbed wire was a building 
of surprising taste. Its roof was 
a stark white, terraced to match 
the uneven terrain around it. Its walls 
were glass, reflective and 
dark to keep out the heat of the 
day. But as the air began to cool, 
they cleared, emitting warm yellow light 
against the blue of the desert at night. 

The van rolled to a halt, just 
outside the building. Out stepped 
a man and a woman. The woman, 
blond, wore a blue-back suit with a 
severe white collar. The man was 
similarly well dressed in a 
light colored [[powder gray]] suit. 

The doors slid open. Out stepped 
a man, heavily and tanned with 
salt and pepper hair and flashing 
white teeth. 

"Mister Francis Stafford? Thank 
you for coming out all this way to my humble 
gallery," he said, extending his hand. 

The woman cleared her throat. "I 
am Miss [[emph]] Francis Stafford," she said. "This 
is my nephew Hector." 

Smoothly, he spun on his heel and 
redirected the offered hand to the woman. 
"My sincerest apologies, Ms. Stafford. 
I am Simon Bigelow, curator of this 
humble gallery. Shall we go inside, 
before the wind rises?" 

Irene, playing [[_]] Miss [[_]] Francis Stafford, 
took Bigelow's hand and let him 
walk her indoors. Sebastian, or 
rather, Hector, turned back to 
watch Mick drive off before following 
them. 

(( the description of the gallery goes here ))

Sebastian was happy to let Irene 
take lead in entertaining Bigelow. 
He had initially balked when he had 
learned that he would be accompanying 
her on the tour that was 
doubling as an initial reconnaissance, 
but Thompson had insisted that he join 
her. 

"Better than trying to lug you in with 
us through the gunfire," he said. "And 
Irene will keep you safe until we can 
regroup."

Erika correctly interpreted his quick 
glance in her direction. 

"Not going with you. Irene is a much 
more gracious guest than men. And these 
people will need my help getting past 
the guards." 

So Sebastian had joined Irene for 
a private tour of the Gallery. They briefly 
discussed posing as 
husband and wife, but shot that down 
almost as soon as it was mentioned. 
Aunt and 
nephew would have to do. Francis and her 
non-existent brother Patrick Stafford 
were heirs to the Stafford 
aquatic manufacturing industry, and Hector, 
Patrick's artistically inclined son. Francis 
apparently was interested in purchasing 
pieces from Mikels for her own collection. 
Sebastian didn't feel particularly well 
prepared to pretend to be a wealthy 
young artist, but after donning some 
proper clothes for the first time in 
months, he felt a little better about it. 

Mikels had walked them into the 
Gallery's impressive entrance way. 
The walls were white and unadorned, 
but as the come together at the 
cathedral ceilings, they sharded into 
geometric planes and patterns, inter-
spersed with glass, letting 
through the deep blue sky above. 

"How was your trip? Not to strenuous, 
I hope?"

"Until (airport) it was fine, but 
after? Terrible. 
An unending nightmare, though we did eventually 
arrive. Let's put it behind us, along with if in a particularly 
unattractive ride." [[ behind us, along with that particularly unattractive ride and its boorish driver. ]]

"I thought it was quite an adventure, 
Aunt Francis," Sebastian added, 
feeling he should at least nominally contribute 
to the conversation. 

Mikels look [[ed ]] sharply over to him. 
There was a strange intensity to his 
expression that made Sebastian uneasy. 

"Well, I'm glad that you eventually
made it. If you need to rest, I have 
accommodations prepared."

"That's a kind offer, but 
the only thing 
keeping me together is 
anticipation of 
your wonderful gallery. 
I shall be crushed if we don't 
see at least a bit tonight."

Mikel smiled at the flattery. "Very 
well then. Let's get started right away. 
I'll have refreshments served to us while 
we are en route." 

Mikels stood from his seat, and with 
a grand gesture directed the to follow 
him. (( they were probably eating )). 
As he led them from the room, Sebastian 
and Irene exchanged a quick glance 
of relief. The rest of their team was 
scheduled to arrive in just over an hour. 
Ideally they should see as much of the 
facility as possible before then. 
Simons led them back through the 
foyer, this time to the impressive 
set of doors at the back of the room. 
The plaster relief, swirling waves 
among cragged mountains, seemed 
at odds with the otherwise minimalist 
design of the space, but Sebastian 
quickly spotted the reason for the 
incongruity: heavy steel bolts secured 
the frame to the walls. No doubt the 
door was composed of reinforced 
steel, disguised by the plaster. A closer 
examination revealed 
additional hidden security measures: 
steel cabling over the windows, 
fire doors hidden in recessed cubbies 
in the walls. 

(( Maybe make the SCP-ness of 
The Gallery a surprise? ))

Mikels entered a combination 
into the keypad by the door and 
submitted his fingerprints. With 
a pneumatic hiss, the door 
swung open into the Gallery. 

Sebastian immediately recognized it. 
The barren walls, the ash 
wood floor. In this room hung huge 
photographs of unsettling figures of light 
blurred against a dark 
field. But elsewhere, there would be 
the artifact of feathers and teeth. 

Simons led them into the first gallery. 

"The antechamber of the gallery is 
both the beginning of my collection and 
my beginning, as a collector." 

Simons stopped aside [[ beside ? ]] the largest of 
the photographs. Though it stretched 
nearly from floor to ceiling, little 
detail could be made of its subject. 
Long columns of light suggested human 
legs, a twisting texture could be either 
scales or dappled shadow. 

"I was born into wealth," Simons 
said, gazing up into the print. "and
expensive taste. 
When 
my parents passed, they left me both 
their wealth and their own extensive 
collection of art."

"At first I did not understand it---
great expense for what? For paintings 
a 'five year old could make'? But in 
grief I was desperate to understand what 
they had left to me. I consulted with 
curators and artists. They helped me 
to cultivate and understand my own 
emotional reactions to art. But as 
I begun to understand art, I 
realized that my tastes had begun to 
diverge from my parents. In both life 
and death, we truly were different people."

Simons turned from the _______ to face 
Sebastian and Irene, though he 
seemed to be looking beyond them. 


"A question soon rose to 
my mind---was there a piece of art that 
elicited a universal reaction 
from all those who viewed it? Something 
so beautiful or horrible that 
it would cause [[inspire]] awe or horror 
regardless of its viewer's social status, 
country of origin, their way of life? 
For a long time it seemed that no 
such piece could be found---no 
matter the beauty some expert [[ there's some other word for this ]] or 
layperson would find it boring or trite, 
no matter the scandal, someone is 
perverse enough to find it tantalizing."

"But, after years of searching, collecting 
what poor samples could come close to 
this question of 
singular interpretation, 
a work of surpassing strangeness 
was brought to my attention. A sculpture 
of marble carved by a young 
artist from Marblehead. All those who 
viewed it came away with tears in their 
eyes, fell into a stupor of contemplation 
for the next several days regardless of 
their wealth or walk of life. I flew out 
to meet her immediately."

((Understand the emotion, understand the impact of the sculpture to escape it? ))

"It was being shown in a small 
gallery, in a small town. But artistic 
minds from around the world crowded 
into that tiny galleria. But despite 
the crowds, there was no murmur, 
no chatter, not even the flash of 
photography. Just a hundred people 
packed in solemn meditation. The 
sculpture, I could not describe it. A 
human form, grappling with the tides of 
time, entangled in its dual nature 
of beast and intellect. All of these things 
conveyed in silent marble." Simons 
closed his 
eyes. "Still, to this day, it haunts 
my dreams."


He paused, lips moving without sound, clearly 
lost in the memory of that time. Sebastian 
looked back up to the blurry photographs. 
Still, he could glean 
no form nor sense from them.

"The fugue set upon me. 
I spent it desperately trying to seek 
audience with the sculptor, for I knew 
it would not leave me until I spoke to 
her---until I traced it back to its 
source. After many sleepless nights 
and listless days, I convinced her to have 
an audience with me."

"When I met her at last, I was struck 
by how deformed she was. 
There was no physical deformity that 
could be named or defined. Rather, it 
was the way the sheer force of her 
will had moulded her face, her 
eyes, the way she spoke. She knew 
exactly what she had created. She knew 
exactly how it shaped and moulded 
those who saw it. Long had she struggled 
with the death of authorship, the failure 
to transmit even the simplest of ideas 
through art. At last she had overcome it. 
She had discovered the method and the 
means with this first work, and 
she had plans to make more. Immediately 
I offered my patronage. She declined. 
[[ she would not compromise her art. ]]

"I spent many months in that small 
wintry town. *[As I tried to persuade her 
to accept my patronage or to buy her 
works, we spoke often on the nature 
of art.] All the while I remained 
in the grip of the sculpture. My fascination 
with it, and its effect on me and others, 
would draw me to it nearly every 
day with it [[?]]. Before long, I found myself 
craving that intense melancholy, remedicating [[reimmersing?]] 
myself as I felt my mind returning to sobriety. 
In the meanwhile, * . As we spoke, 
I realized beneath her exterior of ambition 
and dedication to her craft, she 
was this melancholy 
I felt---always, she carried 
it with her. Through this shared feeling 
we bonded. Though it was not quite love, 
we fell into it. In the 
shadow of her first creation, I waited 
for her next.

"But there was no second creation [[ sculpture ]]. One 
day, I went to her studio. It was empty, 
ransacked. Her tools, her belongings were 
gone. I ran to that tiny gallery. The 
sculpture was gone as well."

"The next years of my life were lost 
in a haze of desperation to find her, to find the sculpture. 
The search was fruitless for many years, 
but wealth brings answers. After 
many years, I learned of what had become 
of her and her work. They had been 
spirited away, by an organization that 
referred to as the Foundation." 


(( There's a lot of monologuing. Gotta find a better way. ))

"The Foundation is a name 
well known to those of us who have 
stumbled into the world of the paranormal. 
They have taken it as their mission to 
secret away all those things in 
this world which seem inexplicable 
or impossible, allowing your average 
man to believe he lives in a world 
of sense of scientific order. Any 
anomaly, be it ancient artifact, impossible 
invention, or even remarkable 
individual, is squirreled away to 
protect this illusion of normalcy." 

The sculpture and its artist were 
of course, anomalous. A 'memetic agent', 
was the term they used, and they 
must immediately be removed from the 
public eye. As soon as I learned this 
I demanded to speak with them, to 
know what had happened to her and 
her sculpture. They ignored my demands 
at first, but money loosens tongues. 
Especially when you have an international 
organization to run. But even though 
money loosened their tongues I could not 
achieve what I had set out to find. 
I demanded to see the sculptor, 
and I learned she had killed 
herself---they would not let 
her continue her work. I demanded to 
see the sculpture. They refused. It 
was 'in containment'. No one was allowed 
to view it to privet the spread of 
the psychic contaminant.

[[ It's not just the feeling, it's also its draw to other people ]]

"Psychic contaminant," Simons 
repeated to himself, shaking his head. 
"For all that is lost in those two words."

"But money speaks. At last I had a 
use for my parent's wealth. [ Once it had 
funded one obsession, now it founded another. 
In exchange for a dangerous donation they 
allowed me to this facility.] In the heartbreak 
of losing the sculptor I transferred my 
obsession to the world that had taken her. *
This 
is my third and final collection. The 
first I gained when I lost my parents, 
and lost when I found the sculptor. 
The second I gained when I found the 
sculptor and lost when I lost her. 
The last I found when I found the 
foundation and the world it tries to 
hide away. 

"The selection you are to see today 
is a collection of rarities from this 
world of the strange and the occult, chosen 
for the unique perspective of the 
aesthetic that would otherwise 
be lost to the vaults of the 
foundation. The ones you will see 
are those that have been deemed 
safe enough for select guests to view, 
though I assure you that there are many 
more."

"The photos in this room are of the 
sculpture that spawned [[ inspired ]] this collection, though 
this is the limit 
to which it can be reproduced without
any psychic effect. Any more 
detailed and the melancholia of the 
original begins to show through."

"Where is the original?" Sebastian 
asked. "Do you have it?"

Simons smiled. "I do."

They left the room of photographs. 
The next was a room dense with oil 
paintings. Simons stood by the door, 
indicating that Sebastian and Irene 
should take their time to peruse the 
paintings. 

"These were all produced by a painter 
at the beginning of the impressionist era. 
Another genius, allowed to shine a little longer 
than my sculpture [[sculptor]] before the Foundation 
found him. Perhaps because his 
stylistic [[??]] vision was only afflicted on the 
subjects of his paintings."

Sebastian paused beside a canvas of 
a foot and a half at head height. 
Thick layers of colors warred with
each other for resolution. 
From the fray emerged a portrait of 
a young man, straw hat pushed 
far back on his head, eyes wide and 
haunted. 
Sebastian imagined that he 
could see the warring colors reflected in 
the portrait's fearful eyes. If he had seen 
the world as the artist had seen 
him, it must have been beautiful, but 
maddening. 

Sebastian tore his eyes away from 
the paintings. Irene had engaged Simons 
in conversation and was guiding 
him slowly into the next room. Sebastian 
hurried to keep up. 

The topics of art, wealth, and culture 
as a whole kept Simons 
at a steady pace through the galleries. Irene 
performed a masterful dance, at once 
maintaining Simon's attention and 
mapping out each room with sidelong 
glances as Simons regalled her with 
tales of his collection. Sebastian tagged 
along, at once imp-
ressed and overwhelmed. 

He was supposed to be scouting 
as well, to reconcile reality 
with his dreams. No doubt that this 
was the right gallery---the walls and 
floors, the emptiness and light---
were intensely familiar. But its 
contents, sculptures and historical artifacts 
and strange machines, were bewildering 
and surprising. In his dreams, the halls 
were [[had been]] empty.

As Irene let Simon lead her through 
the gallery, Sebastian passed bone flutes 
rich with carvings, scepters and 
crowns caked with jewels 
glittering with unearthly light. 
One room was filled with ramshackle 
machines composed of scrapwood and 
garbage that nonetheless ran 
merrily on, delighting in their own 
creaking [[croaking?]] sounds.
Sebastian was enrapt, watching a 
display of swirling mist trapped between 
a thin glass pain[[pane]]. Strange streams through 
it followed the tips of his fingers as 
he let them drift in front of the glass. 
The streams split in response, 
spreading fractally like the 
limbs of a tree...

"You are an artist yourself, are you 
not, Hector?" 

Sebastian jumped, startled [[redundant much]]. Simons had 
snuck up on him, alone in the room. Quickly, he realized that he 
had not heard his and Irene's voices for 
some minutes. He spun around, looking 
for her.

She was there, in the distance, negotiating 
coffee with one of Simon's staff. 

"Charming woman, isn't she, your aunt? 
But a bit of a talker. But I've already 
heard all her kind has to say I'd much 
rather know what's happening in your 
mind."

"I'm just admiring your collection," 
Sebastian said cautiously. "It's very...eclectic."
"No need to keep your self from me," said Simons. 
"I know how it is for you artists---
you jealously guard your self, only letting 
it be expressed when tangled and distorted 
through the medium of your choice. But 
always there, laid bare, waiting to be 
unearthed like buried treasure. It gets 
better when you let go of that reticence
---let the full of you shine through." 

Sebastian stepped back. "I'm not sure that 
my self is something I'm inclined to 
share."

"Is that so? Why is that?"

Simons' eyes were wide, almost 
hungry. Sebastian glanced 
back towards Irene, but she was gone. 

"Is it something that can be shared?" 
Sebastian said. "There's no such thing as a self, 
just how I perceive myself and others perceive 
me."

"So then you don't believe my story." 

"It's not so much that I don't believe it. 
Rather, I'm just not 
interested. Diversity of opinion 
is an important part 
of understanding art and our 
reaction to it."

Simons seemed delighted by his 
objection. "Very true. My tastes have 
evolved since that fateful encounter, 
and have expanded to some items that 
might be closer to your interests."

Sebastian started to regret 
doing anything other than playing dumb. "Is 
that so?"

"But they [[aren't displayed in]] 
this gallery. They are a little too 
dangerous even for private viewings. But 
I think I can make an exception for 
you."

Simons smiled conspiratorially, but Sebastian 
didn't reciprocate. "Aunt Francis---"

"We can leave her on her own for a 
bit, shall we?"

Irene probably would appreciate some time 
away from watchful eyes. Even now 
he wasn't sure exactly where she was. 

[[ end of notebook ]]
Sebastian swallowed his reluctance. 
"Well in that case, let's go."

"Excellent," said Simons. "Please follow 
me."

Simons led him along a 
winding path through the galleries. Sebastian 
tried his est to remember its 
twists and turns, 
but found himself 
quickly disoriented. He only knew that 
they were headed towards the Gallery's 
heart. 

Simons pulled him into a rare darkened 
corner of the Gallery. He slid open 
a featureless panel, flush with the 
wall around it. It led to a small alcove, 
illuminated by a harsh orange light. 
There was another door here, heavy set 
in steel beside another key pad and 
fingerprint sensor [[scanner]].

"In the Foundation's mission, more often 
than not, they find themselves stewards of 
entities of great danger," he said, punching 
his code into the keypad. "The containment 
of these entity [[ies]] often require staffs
of several thousands. But 
careful curation allows my small 
site to operate with a minimal amount of 
support, and thus a minimal amount of 
interference."

With a hiss, the locks of the door 
opened. Simons pushed it open to 
reveal a stair case leading into the 
dark. Sebastian hoped that Irene had 
seen which way he'd gone. 

The staircase had the same dim industrial 
lighting. The walls 
were rough concrete, the stairs 
metal grating the [[that]] clanged and 
groaned as they walked. 

"So, Hector, what is your 
medium of choice?" 

"Nothing collectible," said Sebastian. 
"I do performance art."

Sebastian was counting the 
stairs. They were at least forty feet 
beneath the Gallery now, more to come.

"Performance art? An interesting choice 
for someone who doesn't feel inclined 
to share themselves."


"It wouldn't be a performance 
if I was being myself, would it?"

Simons was delighted. "Well said. 
There's more to you than meets the eye, 
isn't there? You'll find that this is the 
case with many of the items of my 
collection." 

At last they reached the bottom. 
Here there were huge bay doors which 
must have weighed several tons. Again 
Sebastian entered his authorization, and 
they began to open with a drawn 
out shriek of metal agony.

Above the bay doors were two 
huge pipes topped off with shut valves. 
Simons noticed Sebastian's 
attention on them. 

[[probably should actually have water]] 

"It's standard practice for your typical site would have mechanisms 
to flood the entire facility in the 
event of some kind of breach. Infeasible 
in the desert naturally, so instead they 
use a mixture of sand and water, 
resulting in a substance much like 
quicksand. But don't worry. I don't 
foresee ever having a use for it."


At last the door 
was open enough for them to 
pass under. Simons quickly went to 
the control panel to shut it behind them. 

If he had thought the Gallery was mazelike, 
its underbelly was the true labyrinth. 
Dim lighting traced out meandering 
paths among low concrete walls 
and square [[ squat ]] cells.

"Amazing, isn't it?" Simons said, 
joining him at the railing overlooking 
the maze. "Over three hundred artifacts 
are stored here, all perfectly preserved. 
The vast majority can't even be viewed, 
but where possible we've taken measures 
to allow them to be...appreciated." 

Simons headed down to the floor 
of the labyrinth. Sebastian looked back 
up towards the gallery, all too aware 
of the fifty feet of stone, the slurry 
of sand and water between him 
and the surface. More concerning was 
that the dark maze
beneath the Gallery was completely 
strange to him. The artifact in his 
dreams had been in the light and 
space above the above ground Gallery, but 
from what Simon had said and the danger 
of the artifact it was almost certainly 
somewhere in this maze. But where?

What if he had been wrong? 

"Coming, Hector?" 

"Yes, of course." 

Sebastian followed Simons 
down into the maze. As 
they passed through the dim halls, Sebastian 
caught glimpses of other people hurrying 
by, heard their footsteps echoing 
against the walls. 

"Tell me more about your art," 
said Simons. "As a curator, 
my 
only legacy, outside of the collection 
itself, is its influence over artists like 
yourself."

He and Irene had practiced scripts
on the way over. Hector Stafford was 
meant to be a self absorbed 
artist, more concerned with the 
social benefits of being an artist 
than the art itself. Sebastian had 
unfortunately already deviated from 
the script, and he could see some 
use in deviating more. 

"I've been thinking about justice," 
said Sebastian. "And deceit. Specifically, 
the way that the pursuit of justice 
allows us to exercise our most 
brutal urges."

"And we deceive ourselves into believing 
our actions are just."

"When instead they are fed by the 
most bestial part 
of us," Sebastian said, agreeing. 

"Fascinating," said Simons. "How 
do you intend to express this?"

"That's the hard part," 
Sebastian admitted. [ "What 
did you want to show me?" ]

[[I've been having such difficulty finding the right inspiration]]

Sebastian cast his eyes around him.
Already he was completely disoriented, 
and unlike the Gallery upstairs there 
were no landmarks to recognize. 
Only unending corridors and identical 
stone doors, only distinguished by 
a small numbered plaque."

"Hmm, well, there were a few 
pieces I had in mind, but after 
hearing the specifics of your interests, 
one in particular comes to mind." 
Simons stopped suddenly, turning on his 
heel to choose another path down the 
maze. [[ I feel like I can do better with the atmosphere of the maze, and Simon's character. ]]

"It's a labyrinth down here," 
said Sebastian. The halls were eerily 
quiet, filled only with echoes from
distant sounds. 

"There's a reason for that," said 
Simons. "
Not very practical, but I 
find it preferable to the foundation's 
normal practice of 
rows of pillbox cells. 
This way you can indulge your desires 
to wander." 

[[ never did follow up on that. If I need some extra excitement we can unleash something terrible onto them ]]

[[ also there's a line break here I don't understand? seems to be matched by one before 'it's a labyrinth down here', maybe it's just an optional section. ]]

Simons stopped suddenly. Sebastian 
almost bumped into him. 

"You know, Hector. It's remarkable 
how closely it suits you, this piece. 
Justice, brutality, the 
unfeeling superego and the hungry 
id..." Simons turned to look at him 
closely. 
His white teeth flashed oddly in the 
dim lighting.
"But I've found that there is much 
that is remarkable in our mundane 
world. Including you, it seemed." [[seems]]

Simons leaned in close. 
Before 
Sebastian could react, he had [[delete had]] reached 
out to push his fingers 
under Sebastian's collar. Sebastian 
flinched, pushing Simon's hand away. 
His fingertips were wet 
with blood. 

Sebastian grabbed at his collar. It 
was rapidly staining red. 

"Perhaps you would 
not be out of place at the Gallery 
yourself---"

The lights shuddered, 
once, twice, then flickered off. Heavy 
silence fell as a hundred tiny electrical 
sounds suddenly disappeared. 

Sebastian and Simons both looked up as 
dim red lights took their place. 


"The emergency generators," 
whispered Simons. "What's going on?" 

Simon unstrapped the radio on 
his waist, demanding an explanation 
for the loss of power. But there 
was no response, just a storm of 
static. 

"I need to return to the 
Gallery," he said, when it became 
apparent that no response was 
forthcoming. 
"But you---perhaps it is 
safest for you to be in one of 
our spare containment cells," he 
said, grabbing Sebastian's wrist. 
"There's an empty one just
around the corner."

Sebastian pulled away, but Simons' 
grip wouldn't break. 

"You're insane! My aunt---"

"She isn't your aunt, is she? 
All this pretense---I would never part 
with any of my collection, nor do I 
host private tours for the rich with 
nothing better to do. But I am always 
open to new acquisitions..."

Sebastian fought to break away, 
but Simons simply yanked at his arm, 
throwing him off balance. 
Half-dragging, he began 
to pull Sebastian down the hall. 

Simons dragged him 
around a corner, pulling open the door 
to a cell. Sebastian grabbed at the 
frame as Simons tried to throw him 
inside [[the blood on his collar beginning to run and slick both of their grips]]

"Don't make this harder than it 
needs to be," he said, prying Sebastian 
off the frame. "If you just cooperate---"

"Interesting. I was just about 
to say the same thing."

There was the unmistakable click 
of a gun's safety. Simons immediately 
let go of Sebastian and raised his 
hands. Sebastian didn't bother---he 
recognized the voice. 

"Erika," he sighed 
with relief. 

"Hey, Sebastian. Looks like it 
was a good idea to come find 
you first," she said, 
keeping 
both gun and her attention on 
Simons. "Disarm him 
and take his radio."

Sebastian picked himself up, 
ignoring the shaking in his knees. 
Simons glared at him as he pulled the 
radio from his belt. Sebastian ran 
his hands along Simon's suit, 
quickly finding the pistol concealed 
in its holster under his suit. 

"Do you know how to use that?'

"I think so," said Sebastian. The 
gun was oddly heavy in his hand. 

"Rack the slide. Don't pull the 
safety until you're ready to shoot." watching 
Sebastian fumble 
with the gun out of the corner of her 
eye. "As for you, Mr. Curator, I 
expect your full  cooperation. Any less 
and you will 
be dead."

"You can't," he protested. "I have 
the only access codes---"

Erika cut him short. "You're a foundation agent, aren't you? 
Does the designation H-397 mean 
anything to you?" Simons nodded 
slowly. "Then you know that you've already 
told me the access codes. Keeping you 
around only saves me the trouble 
of cutting off your thumb? Is that 
clear? If at any point you become 
more troublesome than 
carrying around your dismembered [[bleh, stop after 'is that clear' ]]

[[ also, Simons needed to open this door with his access code, which is how she knows it already. ]]
thumb, I will not hesitate to 
shoot you and do so. Or rather, 
Sebastian will." 

Sebastian experimentally closed and 
reopened the safety. "Normally I'm 
opposed to these sort of things, 
but he did try to 
'add me to his collection'." [[I've had rather too much of that lately.]]

"Maybe it was a bad idea to give 
you a gun," said Erika, wincing. [[ eyeing him carefully ]]

"Maybe. Where are Irene and the others?"

[[ They're not coming, they traded you for information. Sucks to suck, Sebastian. ]]

"On their way down," she said. 
"Clearing our way out. The 
plan is to rendezvous with them 
once we grab the artifact."

"No!" Sebastian blurted out. [[Erika looked at him strangely.]]
 "We need to 
go somewhere else first. There are 
records, somewhere. 
Before we go to the artifact, 
we need to go there first." 

Erika frowned. "Is this something 
you augured?"
"You need to trust me." said Sebastian. 

Erika narrowed her eyes, no doubt 
remembering her earlier suspicions 
of him. 

"Fine," she said. "I'll 
let 
the others know there's been a 
change of plans. We'll meet up at the 
artifact. Speaking of which, where is 
the artifact?"

"Ask Simons. He was taking me 
to it, before you showed up."

[[ That's not what it looked like to me. ]]

"Well, then, Simons. Where were 
you taking him? Don't lie---I can 
tell."

"I refuse."

"I don't need 
you tell me. But both you and I will 
prefer if you did. I because I hate 
touching people, and you because your 
severed hand is going to start looking like 
a much better companion."

Erika waited for his response. Simon 
met her gaze defiantly. Sebastian
nudged him with the muzzle of his gun. 

"A-973. Room 193A."

"And the records room?"

"Room 008."

"Thompson---change of plans, we'll 
meet you at the artifact. It's at 
room 192A, towards the west. 
We'll meet you there shortly."

"Roger. We've just got access 
to the basement. We'll be at 192A 
shortly."

Erika pocketed her radio. "Are 
you ready to go, Sebastian? Just 
keep your gun on Simons. I'll 
take care of the rest."

Sebastian swallowed the lump in his 
throat. "Yeah."

"Simons, you go first."

Erika stepped softly into the hall. She 
pulled the mask back over her face. 
In the un-illumination of the emergency 
lights she was little more than a shadow 
in the dark. Sebastian 
looked self consciously down at his 
light gray suit, thought it was 
quickly growing darker as it soaked 
blood from the wound at his neck.

"Are you okay?" Erika whispered.

"Yeah. Just as usual."

"What does it say?"

Sebastian quickly glanced 
at the skin under his collar. "Can't tell," 
he said. "I'll have to wash it out later."

Erika nodded, and let them fall into 
silence. 

Simons tried to drag his feet, but 
Erika kept him to a swift pace, 
encouraging him with the barrel 
of her rifle when he faltered. Sebastian 
followed mechanically behind. Quickly 
Simon's gun began to grow heavy in his 
arms. Small sounds in the 
distance made his heart leap erratically 
from beat to beat. 

A clatter of gunfire split the 
silence. Sebastian's heartbeat began to thunder 
in his ears. The world seemed to 
narrow in focus to the gun, 
Simon's back.


Simon's stopped. Ahead, Erika 
held an arm out, holding him back 
at the turn of a corner. Moments later some distance 
down, a stomp of footsteps. 
They grew louder, throwing echoes down 
the corridor, then quieter again. 
Erika waited a moment, then gestured 
that they should continue. 

"I can feel them coming," she 
said quietly to Sebastian. "Don't worry."

Thus they continued, moving 
falteringly: quickly when they could, 
otherwise stopped at Erika's 
direction as patrols of guards 
moved past, to other parts of the maze. 
As Erika held them in the shadows, 
Sebastian saw Simons' lips tighten, 
tempted to call out to the guards. But 
no sooner could he entertain the thought 
than Erika would remind him to cooperate 
with the barrel of the rifle. 

[ Erika holstered his pistol and unstrapped 
the rifle from her back. As she did 
so, a trickle of sand dislodged itself 
from her back. She had come in through 
the flood gates, he realized. ]

Occasionally, the 
silence would be broken by gunfire 
and guttural screams. A good thing, 
Sebastian said to himself, trying 
to rationalize [[away]] his mounting fear. 
It meant the others were still around 
to cause trouble, and keep trouble 
away from them. Indeed, Erika would 
always seem to pause after each 
sign of conflict and redirect them 
one way or another. 

Erika brought them to a halt 
again. Carefully, she peered around the 
corner. It was the long central hall at 
the center of the labyrinth, without corners to hide behind. Far away, 
there was the sound of gun fire, 
but no nearer sounds. 

Erika holstered her pistol and ...

"Room 008 is beyond the hall," 
she said, looking over to Simons. "As 
far as I can tell there's no one headed 
this way, but there's no guarantee there 
won't be by the time we're down 
to the other side."

A feeling like a burn under 
his skin set upon his shoulders.
Suddenly he seemed 
hyper aware of a tremor in his hands 
and the slickness of his sweat on the gun. 

"Just keep the gun on Simons," she 
whispered to him. "Make sure he 
doesn't run. I will take care of the rest." [[pretty sure she already said this]]

"Erika, I really don't want to---"

[[ Sebastian's dialogue goes before Erika's ]]

"On three, we move. 
Quickly and quietly."

"One, two... three."

Erika threw Simon's ahead of them first, 
following quickly behind him. Sebastian 
threw his legs forward, feeling them 
thud, leaden beneath him. But he kept 
pace, doing his best to keep the gun 
pointed towards Simon's back.

Dreamlike, the corridor seemed 
to stretch as they neared its end. 
Through the 
fog of his labored breathing and pounding 
heart, a new sensation of rising 
fear burnt like bile in his throat.

"Shit, someone's coming," he 
heard Erika say. She spun round, 
back tracking for the 
nearest door. She punched in a pin 
code and grabbed Simon's 
thumb to jam it into the sensor. 
It opened with a click. She 
pulled open the door, throwing Simons 
inside. 

"Too late to hide," she said. "Get 
in there with Simons."

Sebastian did as he was told, and 
found himself crouching behind the door 
with Simons as Erika knelt in the 
frame, taking aim. 

"Which room is this?" Simons was 
hissing into his ear.

"What?"

Simons grabbed his shoulder. "The room! 
What does it say on the door?"

Sebastian looked over to the small 
plaque on the frame. "It says E-108."

Simon's face turned white, looking 
mask-like in the dark. "Don't 
turn around," he whispered. "Don't look---"

[[ This should have unleashed something in the maze for some extra danger, also explains why the thing is a labyrinth ]]

There were shouts coming from the 
corridor outside. Erika fired a spray of 
shots, then ducked back into the room 
as they were returned. 

Simon's gripped tightened on his shoulder. 
Behind them he could hear a wet 
sound, damp and 
slow like some large beast breathing.

Erika fed another round into her 
rifle. There was a pregnant pause, 
then she spun out, unloading another 
series of shots. Among the 
return fire there was a mangled 
scream.

"We need to go. Now." Simons 
was spat into his ear. His 
eyes were comically wide with fear. 

"You'll get shot," Sebastian 
whispered back. 

He could feel Simon's grip beginning 
to dig thin crescents into his shoulder. 
"I'll take my chances---"

Before Sebastian could react, Simons 
bolted out of the door. Startled 
gunfire roared. Erika fired three 
deliberate shots. Silence fell. 

Simons was dead, riddled with bullets
and bleeding out on the floor. Erika 
turned back to Sebastian to ask what 
had happened---

Sebastian leapt out, grabbing her 
by the shoulder, pushing her away from 
the door. 

"Don't look," he said. "I don't 
know what it is, but don't look. 
He inched back, groping blindly behind 
him for the door's handle. "That's 
what he said, Simons. And now he's 
dead."

Sebastian traced his hands along 
the door, at last finding the handle. 
As he grabbed it, he thought he felt 
a cold, sliding touch on his fingers. 
Shuddering, he shut the door. It 
locked soundly behind him. 

He collapsed to his knees, a 
shaking mess. Erika knelt down beside him. 

"Are they dead?" he asked. 

"Yes," she answered. "But now that 
they know where we are more will come. 
We should get moving."

She stood. To his surprise, she offered
a hand, though it was gloved. 
Sebastian took it.

"I really will have to cut 
off his thumb now, won't I?" Erika 
said, dismayed. "Do me 
a favor: look away and think 
about something that's not severed thumbs."

Sebastian turned to look down the 
hall. 
A dark pool 
like a darker shadow he realized 
was a pool of blood. Another indistinct 
shape was an unmoving leg. Sebastian 
swallowed a lump in his throat. 
He'd almost prefer 
the severed thumb. 

Behind him Erika stood up. 
Her mask was bunched 
up in her hand, no doubt wrapped around 
her grotesque prize. She shoved it 
unhappily into one of the pouches at her 
belt. 

"Do you know where we're going now?"
Erika nodded. "He was headed this 
way." [[ All the foundation buildings are the same ]]

At the end of the hallway, Erika 
stopped, pushing Sebastian 
behind her. Moments later, he heard 
the sound of footsteps, then four 
explosions of gunfire. The footsteps had 
stopped. Erika lowered the rifle and 
continued down the hall. 

Sebastian stepped gingerly over 
the growing puddle of blood. He made 
the mistake of looking down into the 
dead man's eyes, wide and glassy 
under a dark hole through the center 
of his forehead. 
Sebastian felt his stomach turn.

"Are you okay?" Erika asked.

"Yeah," he said, trying to [[push down the]] feeling down the 
nausea. "You're...pretty good at this, 
aren't you?"

"It makes you uncomfortable, doesn't it?"

"Abstractly, I knew this would 
happen, but..." bile rose up in his 
throat. The dead man's eyes flashed
[[ he tries to look away but the memory follows him ]] in his mind. Sebastian bit down 
on his finger to keep himself from 
throwing up. "I don't know how you 
can stand it."

"Eventually you just get used to it," 
Erika said, shrugging. "You learn to think of them as 
just the hands of feet of the guns 
they carry. That's all you are to them."

"Even you?" asked Sebastian. "Even 
feeling their feelings and 
thinking their thoughts, you're okay 
shooting them dead?" Sebastian 
panted, trying to quell the rising 
bile. 

"Well, yes. I mean," 
Erika nudged her 
rifle towards the nearest corpse. "he 
was almost a month out of an 
opiate addiction. And there, his 
friend, was putting off calling his mom. 
And that one there was thinking 
he'd finally confess to cheating on 
his fiancee, but well, none 
of that matters any more." 

Sebastian stared at the dark masses 
on the bloody floor. "You're a monster, 
aren't you?" 

"Pretty much. We should go before 
others show up."

Erika continued down the hall. 
Sebastian wiped the sweat from his hands 
and followed her.

[[she didn't offer him a hand this time ]]

She directed him around a corner, 
where the two of them waited for another 
group of guards to pas them by. Moments 
later, they heard them swearing as 
they found their fallen comrades.

"The thing about empathy," she 
said quietly, under the echoes of 
their urgency. "Is that it doesn't 
get you anything. All it does is make 
you more easily manipulated---less 
of yourself, more of somebody else. 
Killing is the opposite of that. At 
the end of it, I exist. They don't." 

Sebastian wasn't sure how to 
respond to that. Erika continued to 
look out into the corridor, listening 
and watching for an opportunity to 
sneak through. There were 
two guards though, stationed halfway 
down the hall, unmoving. Erika 
quietly stepped out, raising her gun.

Sebastian grabbed her by the shoulder. 
"Can't we just find another way 
around?" [[ she doesn't appreciate being grabbed]]

She shook her head. "That's the 
records room. There's no other way."
A rattle of gunfire in distance, 
Even with the silencer, the shots 
fired like thunder. One guard went 
down, the other got as far as a shot 
before falling as well. Erika paused 
a moment before moving. There was 
no one else coming. 

She walked past their bodies, 
grimacing as she 
emptied the contents 
from her pouch at her belt. 
As she punched in the 
code, Sebastian looked down 
at the bodies. His earlier nausea seemed 
to have left him now. All that he could 
think of was how pitiful the corpses looked. 
Did they have 
families? What kind of dreams did they 
have? What were their dying thoughts? 
He supposed he could ask Erika. 

"We should be quick," she said, 
holding open the door for him. 

Sebastian nodded and stepped inside. 

There was a computer in the room, 
but with the power off its screen was 
dark and inert. Luckily, the remaining 
walls of the small room were packed 
with filing cabinets, helpfully labeled 
and numbered. Erika began to 
haul the bodies 
of the guards inside, leaving 
him to the records. 

It took him only a moment to 
find the record. A-973. 

"The scales of Maat." 

Sebastian quickly looked behind him. Erika was still occupied with ...

Artifact to be kept in an airtight 
chamber in black out container. 
In the event of excessive exposure to light 
or air, containment must 
be restored as quickly as possible by 
an individual with a Kolhberg certification 
of minimum level 5. All other personnel 
should evacuate the 
area until containment has been 
reestablished. 

"Artifact was first unearthed 
from the tomb of ------ in 1894. 
All members of the expedition were killed 
immediately upon contact with A-973, 
except for ------ who returned -----"
He quickly finished reading the file, then 
tore it up.

"What was that?" Erika asked. 

[[ Irene is also after the record's room. Sebastian asks Erika to take him there before she does, she has to choose between him and Freeman. ]]

"It's nothing," he said, knowing that 
she could tell he was lying. "Not important. 
How much longer do we have?"

"Bringing in the bodies might buy 
us a little bit of time, but there 
are still blood stains outside the door. 
But there's no one on their way 
down here for now. More likely they're 
after Thompson and the rest." 

"Do you think they've reached the artifact 
yet?" he asked. 

"They haven't radio'd yet," Erika said. 
"But they should, soon."

Sebastian nodded. "Let me know."

He turned back to the cabinet. What 
else could he look up? 
A couple dozen 
prophecies came to mind---no doubt 
in this room there were answers to the 
questions they posed, but how to go from 
vague ramblings to the Foundation's strange 
indexing scheme?

(( really should ditch the dreams = 
reality stuff. All the future telling should 
come from the scars. He might just 
understand them better.))

(( nix all the minotaur stuff, have 
Simons be killed by the statue somehow))

But the others hadn't reached 
the room yet. 
Sebastian shut the cabinet 
and moved onto the next. These were 
prefixed H. Sebastian pulled
one at random. 

"Humanoid-844: Tumeroids..."

[[ wow am I terrible at picking random numbers. Apparently I always choose the same one.]]

Humanoid, Sebastian thought. There 
had been another number. Quickly he 
thumbed through the files...

"Humanoid 973: Empath.

"Access to H-973 is restricted to 
agents with security clearance below 
level 3. H-973 is to 
be kept in a standard cell 
equipt [[equipped]] with psychic shielding, though 
there is little evidence that it has 
any effect..."

Sebastian stopped reading. 
Immediately he regretted finding 
the file at all. It was all to easy to 
picture Erika here, locked away in one 
of these small cells somewhere in the maze. 
If the mission failed, no doubt that's what was 
waiting for her---in a pre-prepared cage with 
psychic shielding.

"Is that my file?" Erika asked, as 
intuitive as always. Sebastian nodded 
guiltily. "Give it here."


She skimmed through it, smiling 
humorlessly. "They haven't touched it since 
the cult broke me 
out of there [[since she broke out; the scientist helped her]]. You can read it if you like." 

(( they had an old prophet who died))

Erika handed it back. Sebastian 
put it back into the cabinet.

"It wouldn't be right," he said. 

"Suit yourself," she said, turning 
away. She pulled out her radio. 

"Thompson, have you reached room ____ 
yet?" 

Sebastian stared at the rows of files, 
listening carefully to the response 
from the files [[radio]].

"That's odd---no response. From anyone," 
she said. 

"We should probably get going," Sebastian 
said quickly. 

Erika nodded, unstrapping the gun from 
her back. "We're not going to like what 
we see when we get there, are we, 
Sebastian?"

Sebastian's grip tightened around the 
shredded remains of 

[[ he reads the flood, realizes that it means the scales have broken containment, and he's gotten the others killed]]
the record. 

"No, we're not." 

----

The first body they came across had 
not been shot. Instead, there was 
a whole in its chest, yawning and torn, 
as if by teeth. There were more 
beyond it. 

As they neared the room, there was 
evidence of gunfire, but the combatants 
had not been felled by it. Sebastian 
stopped, staring into the unblinking eyes 
of a man collapsed against the wall. 
He, too, had a wound in his chest, 
right where his heart should have been. 

Through the hole, Sebastian could
see the wall behind in, dark with 
slow flowing blood. 

"Sebastian?" Erika asked. Her 
whisper was the only sound in the 
silence. 

He turned towards her, eyes wide 
with horror. "I---" but words failed 
him. 

"Stay here, I'll go ahead---"

"No." His hands tightened around the 
crumpled sheets of paper. He was still 
holding onto the report. "I'll go."

The door to the room was ajar. 
Inside it stank of blood. At the 
center of the room was a short 
pedestal, topped by a 
bubble of clear glass. At one point 
the glass bubble would have maintained 
an airtight seal around its contents, 
but no longer: the glass was spider 
webbed with cracks, shattered by an 
errant bullet. 

[[ it's triggered by a flood; they release the flooding system to break in, which triggers the scales ]]

There were four bodies in the room: 
Thompson, Mick, Freddie, and ____. 
Thompson and Mick had been at the 
door, Mick nursing a wound on his 
upper arm. Freddie was only steps 
away from the pedestal when 
they had died. All of the same cause: 
a gaping hole instead of a heart.

Sebastian stood in front of the 
pedestal. The glass was so thick with 
glass [[cracks]] that he couldn't see beyond it. 
Even so, he could feel its eyes on him, 
the winged, toothed thing of his dreams. 

Sebastian reached out and 
grabbed the glass. With a forceful 
twist he dislodged it from the 
pedestal, though it shattered in 
his hands, driving sharp edges into 
his fingers. Sebastian winced, but lifted 
the case from the pedestal nonetheless. 

It was a statuette. Elegant in its 
simplicity, it depicted a woman, in a 
dress of feathers, and a crown of feathers 
for hair. 

Sebastian dropped the glass case on the 
floor where it shattered. 
"I don't understand," he said. 

"What? What's wrong?" Erika asked. 

"Erika, what do you see?"

Erika stepped closer to the pedestal, 
examining the statuette. 

"It's a statue," she said. 
"Hard to say what of. Maybe a 
crocodile? Or a lion. But it's got 
a woman's breasts."

Sebastian inhaled sharply. 
To each viewer the statuette 
would appear differently. To the innocent, 
Maat, adorned in feathers. To the 
guilty, Ammit, the maneater, 
hungry of heart.

After all this, and still he saw Maat. 
Sebastian looked at the carnage 
it had fought [[??]] the men who had 
fought to bring him here, only 
to die bloodily at their goal. And 
beyond, the Foundation's 
soldiers as well [[ or maybe the Foundation triggers the flood when whatever kills Simons escapes? ]] some trying to 
call their mothers, recovering 
addicts, guilty lovers.
It was me, Sebastian thought. 
None of this would have happened 
if it weren't for me. [[ I knew this would happen]] 

And yet, there were the scales of 
Maat, resplendent.

"Irene and Sean aren't here," Erika 
said.

"They must have been somewhere else 
when the glass broke," said Sebastian hollowly. 

Erika shook her head. She was 
standing over Mick's body. "Sean was 
here. He left his knife behind. 
He was bandaging Mick," she said, pointing 
to a stray scrap of cloth, then to 
a bloodied footprint. "Then he ran."

"What about Irene?" 

"Probably 
not," she turned to Thompson's body. [[ wouldn't Sean have tipped off Freeman? ]]
Its hand was clutched around a 
radio. Erika pulled it free. 
She pressed the button to send several 
times, but her own radio was silent 
on her belt. "He was talking to 
someone, but not us. You said you 
lost track of Irene. Maybe they 
never joined up either."

"Do you think they've gone?"

"Almost certainly. We should as well."

Sebastian nodded. 

"But before we do," Erika unstrapped 
a satchel from her back. "Don't 
forget your prize."

She handed the bag to Sebastian who 
accepted it dumbly. She watched while he 
walked stiffly back towards the pedestal. 
After a moment's hesitation, 
he grabbed the statuette, stuffing it 
into the bag without another glance. 

"Let's go," he said quietly. 

--- 

They managed to leave the 
Gallery with only minimal conflict. 
Erika shot dead only two men, stationed 
alone on one of the Gallery's more 
obscure entrances, but it didn't seem 
to bother Sebastian the way it had before. 

[[maybe they leave through the emptied flood reservoirs]]

Once outside, they looked for the van 
that Mick had dropped Sebastian 
and Irene in, but it had already 
left, leaving tracks in the dirt. 

Instead, Erika helped Sebastian 
up and over the barb wire walls before 
clambering over herself. Once on 
the other side, they began the long 
trek to the road. 

It was nearly dawn when they finally 
made it to the other trucks [[ truck, singular ]]. Sebastian's 
feet were numb with soreness from 
stumbling over the rough desert rocks. The 
new wound on his collar bone 
itched like fire, caked in blood. 
Upon reaching the van, Sebastian 
collapsed into his seat, though he 
couldn't rest quite yet. 

He climbed over the back seat and into 
[[the]] trunk, rummaging around until he found 
a plastic container which they had used 
some days earlier to store food. He 
unstrapped the bag from his shoulder and 
gently lowered it into the container. 
Sebastian pulled the lid over it and forced 
it shut. Some more rummaging 
and he found a roll of duct tape. 
Fastidiously, Sebastian taped lid to 
container, then wrapping it round 
several extra times for good measure. 


Erika watched him as he did this, 
saying nothing. When he finished, 
she climbed into the driver's seat 
and took the van back the way 
they had come. 

Sebastian lay across the seats, 
exhausted. But a gnawing anxiety 
kept his mind from letting him 
sleep. [[ wow spaghetti sentence much ]] That, and the contents of 
the box only inches from his head. 
He couldn't seem to shake the feeling 
that he had sold himself in a deal with 
the devil. But there was nothing to 
do about it now. Too many lives 
had been lost to turn back now. 

[[ delete this bit; when he speaks to Freeman about it later, he's referencing his actual feelings ]]

Uneasy thoughts followed 
his mind, even past when his body 
dragged it into sleep. 

---

There was a gnawing pain at his chest, 
wriggling deeper and deeper into 
his flesh. Muscles and bones 
rent themselves between 
invisible teeth, as it burrowed 
toward his heart. 
[[ too short; make longer]]

Sebastian awoke, clutching at his 
chest, sweat pouring from his skin.
His fingers scrabbled blindly at his 
damp skin, trying desperately to 
stop the encroach of those hungry 
teeth. But there was nothing there. The 
pain only came from his own hands, 
irritating the already enflamed [[inflamed]] 
wounds. 

Sebastian pulled his fingers away 
from his skin. There was blood caked 
thick under his fingernails, 
more smeared on his nails. His 
own, at least literally if not 
figuratively. 

They were at a rest stop on 
some deserted stretch of highway. 
The heat of mid afternoon pounded 
at the enclosed space of the car, 
making Sebastian feel feverish. 
He peered up at the front. 
Erika was asleep, 
at last unable to remain awake. 

Sebastian kicked the car
door. The air outside was only marginally 
cooler, but he felt less likely to suffocate 
at least.

[[ You know, they'd probably die if they didn't wake up. ]]

Sebastian stumbled outside, legs not 
quite willing to hold his weight. He 
pried open the trunk, ignoring the protest 
of his fingers on the hot metal. Desperately 
he needed water. 

Luckily there were still several 
bottles left. In his lack of 
coordination, he managed to spill it half
between his mouth and his clothes. But 
that was enough, for now. 

Sebastian peeled off his suit. It 
clung to him, wet with spilled water 
and sweat. It was completely ruined 
now, stained brown with dried blood. 
Sebastian used it to wipe gingerly at the 
new cut his chest. He succeeded in 
removing at least a little of the dried 
blood, but it would need a proper 
cleaning and dressing sooner rather than 
later. 

He used the car's side mirror
to inspect the cut. It took him a moment 
to decipher the message backwards, 
through the grime.

"In saving yourself you will 
lose yourself."

Sebastian turned away. That much was 
already obvious.

He banged on the driverside 
window. Erika startled awake, 
hands immediately reaching for her 
gun at her waist. Sebastian immediately 
felt bad for taking out his annoyance 
on her. 

"Water?" he asked, holding up the 
bottle.

"Yeah," she said, voice sticky with 
thirst. She pushed open the car door 
and took the bottle from him, drinking 
greedily. Sebastian went back to the 
trunk and grabbed another, which they 
split thirstily. 

"How long have we been here?' Sebastian 
asked as Erika 
crushed the newly emptied bottle. 
"At about 10 or so, I couldn't keep going. 
It wasn't quite so hot 
when I pulled over."

"You could have woken me up," 
said Sebastian. 

"I don't think I
'm supposed to let prisoners drive 
themselves, though it doesn't really 
matter at this point."

"You'll need me to drive if we 
want to get back to the cult within 
three days," said Sebastian. 

"Why three days?" 
she asked.

"We have until then until this thing 
activates again," Sebastian 
said. "Maybe a little longer if 
the tupperware container is actually 
airtight, which I doubt."

"And you want it to activate at the 
cult."

"Yeah."

"And that's your plan?"

"More or less." 
"Jesus, Sebastian." Erika shook her head. 

"It's Freeman's plan too," Sebastian 
said defensively. "I just told him 
what he needed to know to 
get it."

Erika looked down at her feet. 
"It's not much of a plan, is it?"

"No. And somehow it's already 
gone wrong," he said, looking at 
his hands. Water had washed the 
blood from his skin but it was still 
there under his nails.

"Listen, Erika. What I said back 
then, about being a monster, I didn't 
mean it."

"No need to apologize," she said. 
"Because it's true [[-> it's true enough]]. 
And you weren't 
talking about me, necessarily, were 
you?" [[ delete the necessarily]]

"Not entirely," he said. 

"Think about it this way, Sebastian. 
We all play the same game, in the 
end. Just you and I have to play 
with higher stakes. Everybody
just wants to live a happy 
life, but whereas all Mr. Jones has 
to worry about [[is]] making car payments 
and his neighbor's dog shitting 
on his lawn, you and I have to 
risk our lives and others' just to 
win a chance at the same thing. And 
it turns out that regardless whether 
we're worrying about 
the moral caliber of our souls or 
whether bitch Jenny is going to get 
that promotion first, they 
both occupy equal parts of our 
minds. So you and I are lucky 
that we don't have to waste brain
cells on what comes out of a dog's 
ass."

Sebastian smiled. "But you 
have to do both. 
You have to think both about the tarnish on 
our immortal souls and 
Jenny's new promotion." 

"It's more of Jenny than 
anything else," Erika admitted. [[people are so petty]] "You 
would think that smaller problems would 
[[ way too verbose in this section ]]
eventually fix themselves. But it turns 
out that most people cause their 
own problems---so they're reluctant 
to fix them."

"Something I know too well," 
he said. Sebastian turned to look 
down the dusty highway. Shimmers 
of heat over the asphalt and the 
soundless hot air gave the scene a 
dreamlike quality. 

"It makes you think, though," 
he said, still looking out into the 
distance. "If the cost of happiness is 
other people's lives, do we really have [[delete]]
deserve happiness anyways?"

Erika leaned over the steering wheel. 
"All I know is that as soon as you stop 
pursuing it, you may as well be dead. 
There's too many people out there in this world
sitting around waiting 
for happiness to happen to them, 
complaining about it all the while." 


"We have another few hours on this 
highway. Do you want to drive until 
then? I could use the rest."

"Sure," he said. Erika clambered 
out of the car, wiping the sweat 
from her forehead. Sebastian hopped 
in, starting up the car 
as she went around to the passenger's side. 

"You know, it's been three years 
since I've driven anywhere," he 
remarked. "And that was on the other 
side of the road, too."

"You're not helping me sleep easy 
here," said Erika, looking behind 
them as he reversed out onto the road. 

"Worst case scenario you never 
wake up at all."

"I guess that wouldn't be so 
bad," she said, shutting her 
eyes and falling asleep. 

--

"I think that's what I hate 
most about Freeman and his cult. 
Most people who show up there 
are just trying to find happiness, but 
after him and the heart, they forget 
about all that. They serve him and 
his goals instead. And even if he talks 
about universal happiness, that's 
not what he's really looking for." 

[[ and you're going back to him? ]]

---

By dusk, the dust and scrawny trees 
of the desert had begun to give way 
to the flat plains that would accompany 
them to the end of their journey. 
Sebastian was still driving while 
Erika slept next to him. 

On the side of the road was a sign, 
announcing another tiny highway town. 
Sebastian pulled them down the exit. 

"Where are you going Sebastian?"

Apparently Erika hadn't been entirely 
asleep. 

"Gotta rinse out these cuts," Sebastian 
said. "They're starting to throb."

Erika said nothing, but let him 
continue into the town. 


It was bigger than he expected, with 
several rows of houses and a small 
school. A sign off the side of the main 
street advertised a haunted house 
and ____ county's biggest pumpkin. 
Halloween must be around the corner, 
he realized. It must be October---
Sebastian counted out the years in 
his head. October 20XX.

Sebastian pulled into the parking 
lot of the town's single diner. He parked the 
car. Erika climbed out of the 
car before he could, waiting for him 
by the door to the diner. 

Sebastian shrugged, and went ahead. 

The diner's waitress looked over from 
where she was clearing a table. 

"Excuse me, could I use your wash room?"

The waitress froze, staring at him 
blankly. Sebastian shied back, looking 
down to where she was staring. Ah, 
yes. The big stain that was unmistakably blood. 

"Uh [[er]], I had a terrible nosebleed," 
he said. "Could I use your washroom to 
clean up?"

The waitress seemed to accept this explanation. 
She straightened up. "Patrons only," she 

"You've got to be kidding me," 
growled Erika. "He's got blood all down 
his front---"

"It's fine," Sebastian said. "Grab me 
something from the menu. I'm starving 
anyways."

Erika and the waitress exchanged 
suspicious glances as Sebastian 
wound his way through the diner's tables. 
There were a few families here with 
their children, 
young ones surly with hunger, older 
ones with boredom. Sebastian 
suddenly felt self conscious 
about very obvious blood stain. He 
hurried to the restrooms. 

When he left, he had stripped off the 
collared shirt. The 
t-shirt beneath wasn't in much better 
shape, but he looked a little less 
like he had stepped out from a 
murderous night out at the opera. 

He slid into the booth across from Erika. 
Moments later their waitress deposited 
a plate of burgers and fries. 

Sebastian had grabbed it and was 
forcing it into his mouth before he 
could realize it. Two 
mouthfuls in, he noticed Erika 
watching him eat with a mix of 
amusement and disgust [[ not quite the right word ]].

"Did you order anything?" he asked, 
swallowing.

"There's food in the van," she said. 
"I can eat later."

"Are you sure? It's been ages since I've 
had something that's not corn or corn-
based products. When I get out of here 
I'm not sure I'll ever be able to eat 
corn ever again."

Sebastian took another bite of his food, 
though he was already more than halfway 
through his food after less than a minute. 
Erika called over the waitress and ordered 
another burger, two milkshakes, and 
one of each of the sides. Sebastian 
couldn't manage to express his moment
of happiness through a mouthful of food,
but Erika's quick smile 
let him know she was aware of it.

"So are you feeling a little less 
Lady Macbeth now?" she asked, 
pointing [[to his]] this hands. 

"Didn't expect a Shakespeare 
reference from you," Sebastian said. 

Erika scowled. "I'm not an idiot, 
you know."

"Never said you were," he replied. 
"But I thought you said you had been 
'in captivity' your whole life."

"They made sure I knew the basics. 
The foundation," she said. "Especially 
reading---they thought the 
emotional effects were comparable 
to the empathy, and it 
could teach me to 
regulate my emotions better."

"Did it?'

"It did, a little. Helped me 
realize that there was a difference 
between 'real' and 'fake' feelings. 
Though 
they never managed to convince me 
there was a meaningful difference 
between 'other' feelings and 'mine'."

"Do you read much anymore?"

Erika smiled wickedly. "No. I hate 
it. I think enough about 
other people's problems even when 
I try to avoid it."

The waitress arrived with the 
rest of their food. She seemed a little 
more inclined to them now 
that they had ordered a table's worth 
of food. 

"You two from out of state?" 
she tried as a conversation starter. 

"Yes. Just passing through," Erika said 
stiffly. 

"Where you from?" she asked, not yet 
dissuaded. "You should like you're from the UK."

"That's right," said Sebastian.
"You know, we don't get many tourists 
out here---what did you come in for?"

"Just wanted to see a slice of 
your beautiful country," said Sebastian. 
"Get a taste of old fashioned 
Americana."

"Unfortunate it just tastes like 
corn," Erika murmured darkly. [[It probably tastes like corn, you know.]]

Sebastian gave her a glance. 

"Well, let me get out of your 
lovebirds way," she said, 
a little nervously. "Let me know 
if there's anything else I can do for you."

Erika's glare followed 
her retreat back behind the counter. 
Once she was satisfactorily driven 
off, Erika helped herself to her own 
hamburger, chewing it as if it had 
done her wrong.

"There's no need to be rude," Sebastian 
said, watching their waitress gossip 
to the cook. 

"Being polite is a statement of 
personal power to people like her," grumbled 
Erika through her food. [[ Erika complains about the waitress complaining about them to the cook.]] "Her life is
bleak and boring but she's too 
scared to pick up from this place, divorce..., and 
leave. So she lords over what 
she can do like a queen and goes back 
home and cries herself to sleep." Erika 
rolled her eyes. 

"Hey, it's a big deal, leaving every
thing you've ever known behind like 
that." Sebastian said. 

"Well, then don't sit around 
tearing yourself 
up thinking your life's the worst and 
doing nothing about it," Erika 
growled. 

"Well, then what about you?" Sebastian 
asked. "Why don't you leave the cult? 
They let you out all the time, don't 
they? Why not take a van and drive off 
and never come back. Why not drive off now? [[I'm hardly going to stop you.]]"

Erika turned away as if she had been struck. 

"Nevermind," he said, back [[delete]]
seeing the look on her face. "Forget I said anything."

They turned back to their food. Behind them
some child, far too old for it, began to scream.
"There are a lot of reasons," said Erika 
quietly. "The short one is that I've 
tried. They always found me again. Their 
old prophet could always tell where I'd 
run. And when they found me, I'd be 
beaten, raped. So I stopped."

Sebastian felt something sick twist up 
in his throat. But she interrupted him 
before he could speak.

"But that's not the 
real reason. The real reason, 
the long reason is----have you ever 
just 'woken up'? Even though you
you're already awake? Suddenly you 
realize that you've been acting without 
thinking about what you're doing. You 
don't understand why you did all those 
terrible things... It's like that for me. 
All the time. I'm always waking up, 
wondering I can't seem to snap 
out of the dream."

The crying child bawled. At last its parent 
gave in, showering her with assurances, false 
promises that whatever she wanted would 
be granted. The child quieted. 

"There's this idea," said Sebastian, "in 
philosophy, called a philosophical zombie. 
It's something that looks and acts
like a person, but when in reality, there's 
no internal experience. Just a machine, perceiving 
and reacting, with nothing inside."

Sebastian looked up to 
Erika. She nodded her agreement, slowly 
and without any show of emotion. 

[[ it's a bit wordy and awkward; maybe find some better way to convey this idea ]]

"But you're not that," said Sebastian. 
"You told me yourself, you hate the things 
you do around Freeman, in the cult. 
There's something in there that wants to 
be a better person.  You're more than what 
he makes you do."

The two of them watched parents usher 
crying child and her mute younger sibling 
out the diner. She hiccuped quietly in 
her mother's arms while her parents paid 
the waitress their dues in politeness. 

"It's a kind thought, Sebastian. But 
that's not how it works. I only hate it 
when I'm around you. When it was 
just me and the cult, acting for Freeman, 
killing, spying, it feels right. It's 
why I stopped visiting you. Because you 
made me feel terrible about myself and 
the things that I've done."

Neither he nor Erika had the appetite for 
food, now. Erika called over the waitress, 
paid, and packed up the food.
Erika waited at the front of the van while 
Sebastian put the food away and bandaged 
his newly cleaned wound. 

"A while ago, before we left the cult, 
you were going to tell me something," she 
said. 

"Oh," said Sebastian. It seemed like an 
age ago. "I was going to say that you 
couldn't stay at the cult. It looked 
like it was killing you."

"Yeah, I know," she said. "I won't lie. Some 
days I hope that it will." 

---

They came to the cornfields late 
at night, much sooner than Sebastian 
expected. As they drew close to the 
compound, they stopped to switch 
drivers---since Sebastian was still 
technically a prisoner. 

They approached the walls with mixed 
feelings. Erika was returning to 
under Freeman's thumb, Sebastian to 
his cell. And there was the matter of their 
dangerous cargo, set to go off like a 
ticking bomb. 

"What are you looking forward to most," 
he asked, mostly ironically. 

((Erika--shower, climbing through the sand))

"Sleeping in a real bed," she said. 
"No question. What about you?"
"A hot shower. And if they let me keep 
them, some of those chips. Even if 
they're soggy."

"I can definitely get you some 
fries. They serve them at the cafeteria 
every Tuesday."

"Really? They never make it down 
to me."

"That's odd. They do always seem to 
run out."

"I'm going to hold you to it this time. 
No suddenly disappearing without 
a goodbye."

"So say goodbye next time. I can do that."

They weren't expecting a 
triumphant return---Irene and Sean 
had likely arrived long before 
them. But nonetheless, Sebastian untaped 
the plastic container and pulled 
out the bag. It was noticeably heavier 
now than when he had put it in. 
Seeing Freeman waiting for him on 
the temple grounds, he began to prepare 
some sort of deferential 
presentation. Instead, as soon as they 
were stopped, the van's doors were

[[pacing is off here]]
torn open and Sebastian was forcefully 
pulled out. 

Freeman snatched the bag from 
his hands. He unzipped it, pulling 
out the statuette. 

Though it was a statuette no longer. 
From the woman's shoulder blades sprouted 
a lever arm on a pivot. From there 
hung two plates on a delicate chain. 
These extra additions were composed 
of gossamer gold, as if it had been 
pulled from the air itself. 

"This is the artifact?" he said, 
turning it over in his hands. Freeman's 
guards held Sebastian in a kneeling 
position on the ground. "This useless 
trinket is what cost us four beloved lives? 
I'm surprised you came back 
after your little trick."

"What are you talking about? Sebastian 
tried to fight off the guards holding him 
down, failing miserably. 

"We searched your cell, after you had left," 
he sneered. "Do you know what we found? 
Let me give you a hint---it was squirreled 
away in the frame of your bed."


"I can explain," Sebastian gasped. 

"Explain what? 
It 
needs no explanation." Freeman 
grabbed at Sebastian's arm, pushing 
up the sleeve. It was the message Sebastian 
had shown him, blotchy with healing 
scabs. "You used that bloodied pen we found 
to gouge a false prophecy into your arm."

It was hideously obvious now. The 
words were unsteady and warped, the 
depth of the wounds varying wildly, 
some sections already healed, others 
still thick with scabs.

"Now get this waste of life out of my sight."

"Wait!" Sebastian struggled in vain as 
the guards attempted to lift him. "It's not 
what it looks like. I can explain."

Freeman ignored him, turning away.
to return to his rooms. 

"No, wait---" Sebastian scanned 
the departing crowd. "Sasha! 
Sasha, please." 
The red robed figure on Freeman's tail 
paused. "Tell your uncle I can explain. 
Just not here, with all these people 
around. Please---"

The figure did not turn around, but 
continued after Freeman into the compound. 
His guards began to haul him away. 
The rest of the crowd began to disperse 
as well. Only Erika remained, watching 
him, wordless.

---

They deposited him back in his old cell. 
Some things had changed since he had 
left: the table and chairs and 
other amenities Erika had procured for 
him had been removed. The 
sheets and blankets and been stripped 
from the bed. They had been packing 
away his cell, they had been planning 
to let him out.

Sebastian held his head in his hands. 
Life had a cruel sense of 
irony.

There was a knock at the door. Sebastian 
waited for them to let themselves in.

"What is it?" he said, not bothering 
to look up.

"You said that you could explain," 
said Sasha. "Then tell me why. Why 
did you do this to yourself?"

Sebastian looked up, surprised to 
see him. "Do what? 
This?" Sebastian rolled up the sleeve of 
his shirt. Sasha flinched, but stared 
resolutely at the wound.

"Yes. That. We have security footage 
of you, using that pen and your nails 
to," Sasha swallowed. "to harm yourself. 
Why did you do that, if not to trick 
my uncle?"

Sebastian looked at him curiously. 
"This isn't the first time you've seen 
this, is it?"

Sasha shook his head. 

"Who was it?" Sebastian asked. 

"My sister, Maria. She would...
mostly just single cuts but [[ Maya]]
sometimes shapes or words... I didn't 
understand, I still don't."

"What happened to her?" Sebastian 
asked. 

"I don't know," Sasha said quietly. 
"Uncle knows, but he could never 
bring himself to tell me."

"I'm sorry for your loss," Sebastian 
said quietly. 

Sasha rubbed at his eyes with the 
heel of his palm. 

"Thank you," he said. [[ Sasha rubbed at ... ]] "But 
do you know why she do something 
like this?"

"Why would someone long for death?" Sebastian said. 
"I don't know, Sasha. But 
your sister's reasons aren't the same as 
mine."

Sasha smiled sadly, both saddened 
and relieved.

"I need to talk to your uncle," said 
Sebastian. "I've," Sebastian swallowed 
the lump in his throat. "been hiding 
something from you. If i tell him
it will all make sense. Could you 
relay that message for me?'

"I can let him know what you said," 
Sasha said. 

"Thank you," said Sebastian.

Sebastian called out to Sasha just as 
he was about to leave. 

"Sasha, I--- Thank you," he said. 
"Genuinely. For your kindness and your 
concern. It meant a lot to me."

"You're welcome, Sebastian," he said, 
uncertainly. 

"Before you go---the scales that 
Freeman took. Did you see what was 
engraved on the center piece?"

Sasha thought about it. "It was an angel, 
wasn't it? Why do you ask?"

"No reason," said Sebastian. "It's not 
important."

--- 

(( Sebastian was an architecture student.))

(( He willingly went to Bedlam b/c he 
felt like his life was over; it wasn't))

((Discordant pop music playing @ the 
diner))
(( Maybe skip straight to Erika's 
perspective?))

Sebastian met Freeman and Sasha standing at 
the bars of his call. Deliberately he 
had chosen not to unwind his 
bandages, leaving his scars open in the 
air. 

"Sasha tells me you had something important 
to tell me," said Freeman, 
always suspicious. "You've waited more 
than enough of my time, you'd better not 
waste more."

"Where are the scales?" Sebastian 
asked. 

Freeman narrowed his eyes. "What 
does it matter? They're of no use to me."

"You're mistaken," said Sebastian. 
"The scales will purge your organization 
of traitors for you."

"I was led to believe that by 
that on your arm," Freeman said, eyes 
flickering to the scar Sebastian's [[whoops]]. "But that is 
indisputably a fabrication."

"It's a fabrication," said Sebastian. 
"But that doesn't mean it doesn't
foretell the truth."

Sasha let out a gasp of surprise. 
Freeman narrowed his eyes suspiciously. 
Sebastian met his gaze head on. [[ this scene is a bit shitty]]

"Dr. Bedlam's notes mentioned no 
such thing."

"Because I hid it from him," 
Sebastian said. "The reason why is 
obvious."

"I don't see any reason to believe you," 
Freeman said. 

"Because there is none. Not yet. 
But if you use the scales, you'll see that 
it's the truth."

Freeman traced Sebastian's body with 
his gaze, seeing the gouges left by years 
of prophecies. There was no sign of 
uncertainty, not in his posture nor the 
scars that decorated it.

"And why are you telling me this now?"

"Because too many lives were lost, to 
let this endeavor go to waste." Sebastian 
curled his hand into a fist. "Not because of 
my mistake---because of my desire to 
ensure that everything went according 

to plan."

Freeman stepped back from the bars
to consider. Beside him, Sasha stood still, 
fixated on the knotted scars on his chest. 

"I'm willing to entertain your proposal. 
But despite your words, the 
scales seem inert."

"They aren't ready yet," Sebastian said. 
"It requires three days of rest. The first 
it produces the crossbar. The second the 
chains and plate. On the thirds, the feather. 
Only then it can be used."

"And how is it used?" Freeman asked. 

"Gather your men around it on the 
third day, as the feather is complete," 
said Sebastian. "That's all that's needed."

Freeman tugged at his chin. "So 
we still have another day before we can 
test this scale of yours. But in the 
meanwhile there are other things we can 
test."

Sebastian felt a chill tighten on his 
heart. "What do you mean?"
"You claim to act out of a desire to serve 
our cause, using your abilities. 
In that case you can prove it. 
Let 
me test that it's the truth---that 
the future can be written by writing 
into your skin."

Sebastian's hands were shaking. 
The chill spread up into his throat. 

He had to clear his voice to speak. 
"Fine. Do what you will."

---

(( Maybe Freeman does this freaky thing 
where he always speaks in 3rd person? ))

Erika was outside the door to Sebastian's 
cell. Freeman had sent for 
her, but when she arrived at his rooms 
he had already left. She asked where 
he had gone. 

When they had pulled Sebastian 
from the car and threw him to the ground, 
she had done nothing. They had locked 
him back in the cell. She had done nothing
again. And now she was outside his door 
on Freeman's orders. 

A thrill of terror ran down her spine. 
Then a sick twisting in her throat. 
Her heart pounded in her chest 
as if fighting to get out. She found 
she couldn't bring herself to open the door. 
Instead, paralyzed, she could only listen. 

There was a low groan, broken 
by pained pants. A vocali
zation escaped from between 
clenched teeth: an agonized scream. 
Sebastian's she realized. 

"Please," she heard him say. "Please, 
stop. The anesthetic's not working."

"No, not yet," said another voice. Freeman's. 
"The message is not complete. Continue."

Another muffled scream of pain. Erika 
felt her hands clench themselves into fists. 
A wave a revulsion curled up from her 
gut. 

"No, uncle. Stop this. Stop this right 
now." The voice was Sasha's,
shaking. The latter part with punctuated with 
exertion. There was a clatter, metal on 
the concrete floor. 

"It's too much, uncle. 
Killing that traitor, torturing 
him, and now this! He's trying to 
help us! Stand down! Stop! This is an 
order [[underlined]]."

Stunned silence, punctuated only by 
Sebastian's desperate gasps. 

(( Does Erika feel his pain?))

((Probably.))

"Stand aside, Sasha. The prophecy 
will be completed, even if I have to 
do it myself."

The scrape of metal on concrete made 
Erika's heart beat wildly with terror. 
Then agony, a shrill scream of pain 
down the plane of her back. 
The urge to flee seized her legs like 
a physical force. Sebastian was 
trapped; he could not escape what 
was being done to him, but she could.

She ran. 

--- 


Sebastian awoke to the sound of rain,
striking the roof above him. 
Thunder murmured violently in the distance. 
All in all, he was comforted by these 
distracting thoughts. 

He felt weak, strangely floating, 
only tied down to this concrete world 
by the streaks of pain driven into his back. 
The world of darkness and sleep was 
only a moment away. Sebastian resisted 
the temptation to return to it. He opened his 
eyes.

His cell was dark. He was on 
his bed. Someone had restored its sheets 
and blankets and bandaged his wounds, 
both new and old. By his side was 
a hunched shadow, featureless in the 
dark. 

"Erika, is that you?" his voice was 
hoarse. 

"I let this happen," she said. Sebastian 
almost didn't recognize her voice, choked 
with emotion. "How could I let this happen?"

"It's okay, Erika. I wake 
up to worse, all the time," he said. Sebastian 
tried to push himself upward, but 
a twinge of pain collapsed his arm 
beneath him. Beside him, Erika flinched.

"I hate him, Sebastian. I hate that 
he did this to you. I hate what he's 
done to me." She buried her face in 
her hands. "I hate it." [[italicized]] 

The word lingered in her throat, 
bordering almost on a scream. 
Her shoulders began to shake with her 
uneven breath. 

"Are you crying, Erika?"

She looked back up at him. 
He could see nothing of her face 
but a glimmer of wetness in the dark. 
She rubbed her fingers over her eyes and 
it disappeared. 

Sebastian was almost shocked. 
He 
struggled to find the worlds to say. 

"It'll be okay," he said. "It will 
all be okay." 
Sebastian, forgetting 
himself, reached out to comfort 
her. He was only inches from her 
face when he realized his mistake, 
withdrawing his hand. 

But, much to his surprise, she grabbed 
it, holding his hand tightly in her own. 
The fabric of her gloves was damp.

"I've had enough," she said. Her grip 
tightened on his hand, almost to the
point of pain. "Enough of Freeman 
and his cult. I can't bare it anymore. By tomorrow I'll 
won't have to ever again."

"By tomorrow?" Sebastian echoed, 
confused. "What do you mean?"

Erika let go of his hand 
and stood. 

"Goodbye, Sebastian," she said. 

"What do you mean, goodbye?" Sebastian 
said. "Erika, what are you going to do?"

Desperately he wished that he could see 
her face, but all she was was a silhouette 
in the dark. 

She turned away to leave. As she pulled
open the door, the light from the hallway 
briefly illuminated her face. Though 
her eyes were red and her hair 
disheveled, her mouth was set grim
with determination.

Sebastian called after her, long 
after the door hand closed, but she 
did not return.

---

(( Freeman's original inner circle was 
fellow researchers. In a bout of 
paranoia he had them replaced 
with more militant types ))

In the morning, Sasha came to 
take him from his cell. A large, black 
bruise covered the side of his face.

Sebastian awoke, groggy. His sleep had 
been troubled by bad dreams of a strange 
clarity, including 
an encounter with Erika that had 
left him unsure of whether it had been a dream 
or reality.

Sasha said nothing as he unlocked the door of 
Sebastian's cell, and waited patiently as Sebastian 
found his footing on his shaking legs. When 
at last he made his way to the door, 
Sasha quickly looked away, hiding the mark 
on his face.

"Master Freeman would like you to attend this 
morning's meeting of the [[inner circle]]" 
Sasha said quietly. 

"Will you be there as well?" Sebastian 
asked. 

Sasha nodded. 

Sebastian followed Sasha out 
from the cell. As they walked through Sebastian 
couldn't help but look through the rows of 
closed doors, thinking of what was behind 
them. More prisoners, like himself? More 
items of Freeman's collection, like himself? It was 
strange to think of himself as separate 
from them now, on the wrong side of 
the doors. 

"I'm sorry," Sasha said, quietly. "About 
everything. I always try to 
do what's right, but---"

"Don't worry about it," said Sebastian,
looking down the hall. "I've done worse to 
myself, haven't I?"

Sasha didn't reply. They walked 
down the hall in silence. It was odd, the 
first time he'd been out of his cell, not flanked by 
guards. 
"Was it Freeman?" said Sebastian suddenly. 

Sasha tried to stammer out a denial. "I don't---" 
but thought better of it. 
"Yes. For defying him. 
He'd...never done this before."

Tears welled up in Sasha's eyes. Sebastian 
felt something wrench in his chest. 

"You shouldn't go to the meeting, 
Sasha. Just skip out today."

Sasha shook his head. "He asked 
specifically that I be there for the...ritual."

"I see," said Sebastian. 

The ground outside was wrapped in a gossamer 
of frost, and the air was sharp with the 
chill [[ of ]] autumn. Sebastian looked up at 
the cloudless sky and shivered. It reminded 
him uncannily of the lifeless sky above 
the stone gate. 

The meeting was to take place in the 
great hall. The sun, low and bright,
in the dawn sky cast long pillars 
of illumination across the empty wooden 
slats of the floor. Though the hall 
was empty, Sebastian couldn't shake 
the sensation of being 
watched by a thronging crowd of people, 
somewhere between the imprints of faithful
knees [[and] to the drifting dust in the air.

Sasha and Sebastian were among the 
first to arrive. Slowly other in red cloaks 
appeared, taking their habitual spots in a rough 
circle on the stage. In the center, on 
a low stand was a 
strange shape, shrouded in a thin cloth. 

At last Freeman arrived. As he 
strode to his place at the head of his stage, Sebastian 
saw his eyes flicker towards Sebastian + 
Sasha.

"Freeman, why did you have us wear our 
robes?" One man asked, pushing the hood from 
his face. "Is there a special occasion?"

"Good news, Keller," Freeman said, 
though his smile was more cruel than kind. 
"If we have all arrived, I will be 
pleased to present it." 

What murmurs there were in the circle died 
down. All attention turned to Freeman. 

"The first order of business," he said, 
"and the first of our good fortune. Through 
the years, we have sought a means to 
return our consciousnesses to their 
primordial wholeness. Study of the 
world's myths, investigations into ancient 
documents, careful inquiry into 
paranormal phenomena have at last 
brought us to discover the last vestige 
of our ancient connection: the 
tree of life---Yggdrasil. Long 
have we predicted its existence, 
and long have 
we searched for it [[ it's the last vestige by which humanity is connected to others ]], but at last its 
existence have been confirmed."

Freeman produced a file a folder. 
Sebastian immediately recognized 
it as the same as the ones he had seen 
in the Gallery's record room. 

"Irene ____ and Sean 
____, sole survivors of last week's 
expedition to the Gallery, 
managed to procure these documents," 
said Freeman, 
pointedly avoiding Sebastian's gaze. 
"They detail the whereabouts of a tree 
that fits our predictions of the world tree's 
characteristics. [[ the cult had already been planning an expedition; Sebastian changed its direction]] [[ also, apparently the Foundation already knows about the world tree, the big search for it is a bit silly now ]]. As of yet, the Foundation 
seems to be unaware of its importance. 
We must endeavor to seize control 
of it before they realize importance [[bleh]]. 

Quickly, a discussion 
broke out on whether it 
could be true, and how to arrange
a team to investigate as soon as 
possible. 

Sebastian quickly lost track of the 
conversation. Irene must have visited 
the record room shortly after they had. 
*[ Sebastian was glad that he had a chance 
to destroy the file on the scales ]
Then, she and Sean must have left
without him and Erika. * More concerning though 
was Sean, who had survived the scales. 
Had he told Freeman what had 
occurred? [[ had witnessed]]

Sebastian felt his throat dry and his 
stomach turn. He wasn't ready to relive 
that night again either, but at this point, 
he had no choice. He had charted this 
course for himself---it was too late to 
turn back. 

"We all play the same game, 
you and I just for higher stakes." Is 
that what Erika had said? 
Sebastian's hand tightened into fists. 
Soon he would see if the costs would 
be worth it.

Speaking of Erika, where was 
she? On one hand, Sebastian was 
relieved to see she was not here. But 
on the other, Sebastian recalled that 
strange moment in the dark. 
"Goodbye," he thought. "Why had 
she said 'goodbye'?"

Some conclusion had been 
satisfactorily reached. Plans had been 
made to investigate the supposed site 
of the world tree. Sebastian scanned 
the faces of the ______. Some seemed 
excited, eager to have their unlikely theories verified at last. Others 
were grim, perhaps led on one wild 
goose chase too many. 

"Thank you, gentlemen," said 
Freeman. [["]]We will continue our 
discussion at a later time. Now, I 
would like to move on to another 
matter."

"As you know, we have always been troubled 
with traitors---agents from other 
organizations seeking to 
monitor us, or steal our hard 
won prizes. Long have I suspected 
that these agents have penetrated 
our organization at every level.
But perhaps this will be 
a problem no none."

Freeman stalked to the 
center of the circle. As he did, 
Sebastian saw several members of the circle 
shift their eyes to meet each other. Freeman's paranoia was 
apparently well known to them as well. 

[[ Maybe some run-in with another artifact has affected him in some way. ]]

Freeman lifted the veil. 
A moment of confusion broke 
through the circle.

"I present the scales of Maat."

It was nearly complete now. The 
scales, the chain and the plate, glittered 
gossamer gold in the dawn light streaming 
through the tall windows of the great hall. 
On one of the plates, 
as delicate as the shadow of dust, 
was the feather, slowly growing [[ growing slowly]] 
amidst the motes of dust.

But 
there was something wrong. The figure 
at the center was warped, distorted 
as though seen through twisted glass. 
Looking closer, Sebastian could see a 
reptilian cruelness in the woman's 
face. Her hair had turned to a lion's 
mane, her dress changed 
from feathers to teeth. Her face was distorted into the long maw of the crocodile. 

His heart pounded loudly in his ears. 
Freeman's voice, droning on 
the importance of loyalty, faded 
darkly into the background.  [[His heart... ]] 
Only yesterday 
it had appeared to him as Maat. 
But now--what had changed?

The deception---he realized. His 
lie to Freeman had always skirted on the 
edge of falsehood, but that the future 
could be determined by writing it into his 
skin---that was utter nonsense. And it 
seemed it was not enough for Ammit to have 
paid for it with his own blood. 

Sebastian felt his heart settle like a stone 
in his chest. Slowly, but steadily, the feather 
was spinning itself from the 
bright beams of sunlight. 
His heart had been heavier 
than lead since the night at the 
Gallery. Maybe even before that. But 
only now it seemed he had transgressed. 

Could he run? No, then surely Freeman 
would suspect something was wrong. And 
listening to him extemporize on his 
delusion, thinking of Erika's tears in the dark 
and the wounds on his back, 
maybe it was enough that he and Freeman 
die together. 

The skin on his collar bone began to 
prickle, quickly crescendoing to a full 
on stab of pain. The wound from the night 
on [[at]] the the Gallery had begun to open itself. 
Sebastian clenched his teeth as the prophecy 
bit into fresh skin. He pulled his shirt 
away from the skin. 

In saving yourself you will lose 
yourself. In saving 
her you will find yourself.

(( he should have a dream of Erika w/ 
her heart torn out ))

Sebastian looked up. Suddenly all attention 
was on him and the growing stain on his 
chest. Freeman hissed at him. 

"What does it say?"

Before Sebastian could answer, there 
was the unmistakable sound of gunfire. 
A staccato of machine gun fire, then a 
single bang, then silence. 

There was a moment of hesitation. 
Some of the circle pulled out their own 
weapons, others seemed split between 
the desire to run and to cover [[ run to cover? ]]. 
Freeman only narrowed his eyes, flicking 
them to and from the shadows. 

In the meanwhile, the scale's feather 
spread slowly into the sunlight. 

The tension was broken 
by a gunshot, suddenly much louder than 
those before. The man next to Sebastian 
collapsed, gun clattering next to the 
floor [[next to him on the floor?]]. From his chest grew a rapidly 
blossoming pool of blood. Another two 
explosions and another two joined him. 

[[ Erika and the scales are both enforcing their own definition of justice here ]]

The circle broke, some dashing for the 
exits others for cover, others to surround Freeman. Sebastian spun 
around, looking for the source of the 
gunshots [[gunfire]].

There, in the shadow of the hall's 
pillars, a flash of movement swallowed by 
a hail of gunfire. A figure in dark 
clothes flitted in and out 
of sight between the banners that adorned 
the great hall. Sebastian caught a glimpse 
as it stopped a moment to aim down the 
long barrel of a rifle. 

Erika, he thought, as another of 
the _______ fell to the floor. Sebastian spun 
around. The feather was almost complete.

There couldn't be a worse time for this. 


[[ deleted ]]

[[ deleted ]]
An exchange of gunfire assaulted Sebastian's 
eardrums. Bullets tore through the hall's 
great tapestries where Erika had been 
only moments before, but there she 
gone. [[ there she gone. seriously. ]]

An uneasy stillness settled on the room. 
Freeman's men pointed their weapons into 
the darkness, scanning the shadows 
for any movement. [[ when I change this to be flood related, there's a thunderstorm ongoing. extra drama ]]. Just as they began 
to fan out to search, something 
clattered into the center of the stage. 
Sebastian looked over and 
immediately realized his mistake. 

The explosion 
from the flash grenade was enough to 
knock him off his feet. 
He groped blindly 
on the floor as his 
ears rang. As his vision cleared, 
he found himself face to face with 
a dead man, mouth agape at the 
sky. [[staring at him accusingly?]]
"No sudden movements, please," said 
Erika calmly from the center 
of the stage. Sebastian struggled upright. 
She had Freeman on the ground, 
gun forced into his face. 
"Even violent thoughts, and I might 
pull the trigger."

Freeman's men, still blinking 
spots from their eyes, hurried to 
raise their weapons in spite of 
the warning, but Erika didn't seem 
concerned. 

"What do you think you're doing, Empath?" 
Freeman hissed. His face was filled with hate. 

"It should be obvious," she said. 
"I should 
have done this years ago. But 
it for some reason it never occurred to me 
that I could, not until now."

[[ Sebastian had barely registered ... "thinks of interfering" goes here ]]

"What is that you want? Money? 
Your freedom? These things can be 
arranged." 
Freeman was unable to keep
the tremor of fear from his voice. 

Erika smiled humorlessly. "Maybe 
years ago, I could have been persuaded, 
but we've gone too far Freeman. 
Now I only want you dead."

Sebastian had barely registered 
the movement in the corner of his eye 
when Erika swung her arm around, 
shooting the man next to him 
dead. Before anyone could react, her 
gun was back to Freeman. 

"The same will happen to anyone who 
so much of thinks of interfering," she said. 

[[ start bracket ]]
"As soon as you you shoot me they will kill 
you," said Freeman. 

"I've made my peace with that," 
said Erika. 

[[ end bracket]]

There was a coldness in her eyes that 
terrified Sebastian not 
for its cruelty, but the lack of life 
within. As if 
she had been erased 
of everything save for the desire to 
kill freeman. 

In the meanwhile, the last fronds
of the feather were slowly unfurling 
in the sunlight. The eyes of the crocodile 
headed woman glinted with far 
too much life for simple stone. A 
panic welled up in his throat. The images 
of his dream, Erika, heart torn 
out, was all too vivid in his mind. 

"The moment you shoot 
they will kill you," Freeman hissed. 

"I don't care," she said. "I've been 
dead for a long time."

She wouldn't survive the scales, Sebastian 
realized. Somehow the thought 
sent a lurch through 
his stomach that was worse than his 
own death. Sebastian looked around 
panicked. The feather was almost 
complete.

"Are you worried, Freeman, about 
death? What it's like to die?" she said. "You're 
wondering if I know---thinking that 
I must not, because I kill people on 
a regular basis, and I'm about 
to kill you. But I do know what it's 
like to die. It's agony. Are you prepared,
Freeman? You and I will experience it 
together."


"You don't have to do this," said Freeman. 

"No," she said. "But I want [[underlined]] to. I like [[underlined]] 
to kill." Her face was a terrible 
rictus of laughter. "The agony of 
death is worth living through, 
just for that moment of silence. 
And I've been listening to your 
delusions for six years now. I can 
already imagine the relief---" [[ I've been dreaming about this moment....]]

She was going to pull the trigger. 
Sebastian panicked. (( Maybe Erika only sort of sees Ammit? Borderline 
case)) ((or maybe it only kills one 
person at a time)) 
His hands, scrabbling, found 
the dead man's gun. Unthinkingly, he 
pointed it at Erika. 

Almost immediately she mirrored 
the motion, arms leading eyes. As 
mind caught up to instinct, Sebastian 
saw a look of surprise spread over her 
face. She started to say his name.

The gun dropped from her hand. In 
that brief moment of surprise, Freeman
had grabbed at the only patch of bare 
skin exposed at her neck. Her face went 
horribly blank. Her arm drifted slowly 
downward. 

Sebastian dropped the gun. Freeman 
steadied himself, careful never to let 
go of her neck. 

"Such a stupid girl," he said. 
"She seems to have 
forgotten how easily she can be controlled."

Sebastian forced himself to tear his 
eyes away from Erika's lifeless 
expression. From the scales came a 
sound like the hiss of sands or the 
spit of a snake. There was an unfurling 
that extended past the 
bounds of the feather, a presence blossoming 
into wakefulness. 

(( he expected the scales to be bigger)) 

"Sasha," he said. The youth, 
was standing beside him. 
He turned to Sebastian, face frozen 
into an expression of shock. 

"Sasha, take her hand," 
he whispered. "you can save her. 
Please, you [[Sasha has no reason to want to save Erika. I guess he could lie and say that it'd stop her from killing Freeman. which is true. Because Sebastian kills freeman. Because he's just as cruel as Erika. -sigh -]]
have to do it---now!"

(( Maybe Sasha grabs her))

The urgency in Sebastian's voice propelled 
Sasha into action. But at that moment

(( probably Sasha grabs Erika when she's distracted? ))

But no one seemed to notice---all attention 
was focused on the drama unfolding between 
Erika + Freeman. Almost all attention. 

"It's going to kill us," Sasha said, 
voice hushed. His eyes were fixed 
on the scales. 

"Your uncle and I---it's too late for 
us, but you can save Erika." [[ this section goes before he tells Sasha to grab her ]]

Sebastian was blinded by a vision of the 
thing that had found him in his 
dreams. Crazed by its dual nature 
it extended tooth an tendril. Sebastian 
felt a terrible lurching pull at his 
heart. 

This was the end then. It seemed 
fitting 
that his 
only attempt to seize control of it 
would bring its end. But maybe at
[[least]] Erika would survive his folly. 

There was the sound of rushing [[water]]. Still 
unable to see anything but the twisting 
brightness of the creature in 
the scales, Sebastian fell to his knees. 
His chest ached terrible, as it had never 
before---as if it were being rent in 
two---

And then it was over. Gasping, 
Sebastian looked up from where he had 
fallen on the floor. He grabbed at 
his chest, feeling relief find it still 
intact. But others had not been so 
lucky. 

Freeman had fallen to the ground. 
Both mouth and chest were agape, 
facing the empty 
air. Blood pooled slowly beneath his 
body. Several others of the circle like
wise lay on the floor unmoving. 

Sasha and Erika stood at the 
center of the room. Sasha 
stepped away. Erika resurfaced, 
tears welling up in her eyes. Then she
saw Freeman and the tears turned to 
rage, then anguish. Sebastian saw her 
drop to pick up her gun.

"Erika!"

She had the gun raised, ready to 
unleash her anger on Freeman, already 
dead. 

"Don't," he said. "Sasha---"

Sasha was hunched over, tears beginning 
to stream down his face. He knelt down 
by Freeman's body, hands falling to his 
side as sobs overtook his body. Erika 
clutched at her own chest, and holstered 
the gun. She backed away, flinching and 
looking away as Sasha's sobs turned to 
wails of grief. 

Sebastian picked himself up off the floor. 
There was a taste in his mouth like 
hot metal and his limbs felt as 
heavy, but he was alive. * Sebastian 
wiped the blood from his hands onto his 
clothes. 

"Let's go, Erika," he said, quietly.

((Erika visits Maya's grave, Sebastian considers killing the heart, settles for leaving the scales there ))
Waiting at the compound's exit was 
a van. There was no sign of the 
guards. Erika rolled down the window 
as Sebastian approached. 

"Ready to go?"

"I wasn't sure that you wouldn't leave 
without me."

Erika smiled wryly as Sebastian 
hopped in the passenger's side. "I had 
a feeling you would say that."

"Did you finish doing what you 
needed to?" Sebastian asked. 

"Yeah," said Erika, looking 
into the distance. "What about you? 
Did you kill it?"

Sebastian was thrown off by the 
question, forgetting that he 
didn't need to share his concerns 
with Erika for her to know them. 

"No," he said. "I thought about 
it, but in the end I just left the scales 
there. No one like Freeman should 
ever be able to use the heart like 
that again."


"And Sasha?"

"He was gone by the time I got there. 
So was Freeman's body."

"I'm sorry."

"It's probably for the best. I wouldn't 
know what to say to him 
anyways."

[[ It might make more sense for them to try and escape quickly ]]

Though in the end the scales 
had left him alive, Sebastian's 
heart felt heavier than ever. 
If his effort to save F. From Erika had 
redeemed him in the scale's eyes, 
Sebastian had still deliberately sought 
to kill a man and succeeded. Sasha's sobs 
of grief were another thing to 
haunt his dreams at night. 

"What about you? What did you do?" 

"Not much. Took some money, some 
papers." Erika dropped a file into 
Sebastian's lap. "These are yours. From 
Bedlam." ((She's cleaning up trail of S from the Foundation))

 ((Maria => Maya))

Sebastian flipped open the folder.
recognizing the old doctor's handwriting. 
Bad feelings [[memories?]] brought a queasy feeling 
to his throat. Sebastian shut the 
file. 

[[ brackets start]]

"Are you ready to go?" Erika asked. 

Sebastian smiled, but it was bitter sweet. 
"Yes."

"Your first taste of Freedom."

Beyond the walls of the compound the 
sky was a painfully 
pure shade of blue. Towers of clouds 
taller than mountains stretched the 
expanse of the sky, impossibly, unreasonably 
high.

[[ brackets end ]]

"Congratulations, by the way," she 
said. 

"For what?"

"For killing Freeman, before I could." 

"Oh. Sorry."

"It's okay," she said. 
"It's something to put behind 
us. That's what new beginnings are 
for."

[[ put the bracket bits here ]]
(( If you want, you can put all the 
previous scene into the gas station 
scene )) 

[[ not only is it weird that that comment is in second person, but it also makes no sense. ]]

In the bathroom of a gas station alone in the endless 
plains, Sebastian splashed water 
on his face to wake himself. 
Somehow he couldn't quite clear his mind. 

Free now, he was free. For the first 
time in years, there were no cells, no 
locks, no guards. 
He was almost afraid to think too carefully 
about it, lest he notice that it was all a 
dream and wake up yet again in a cell, 
either in the cult or Bedlam. 

"Sebastian."

Sebastian shut the faucet. It was Erika 
from outside the bathroom. 

"Yes?" 

She said from outside 
the bathroom. "So where do you want to go next?"

Next?

Sebastian froze. He almost
hadn't thought about it, not for years. He 
used to while away the hours, fantasizing 
about [[what came next]] 
it, when freedom 
seemed like a far off dream. 
See his mates, finish his degree, apol
ogize to his aunt and uncle...

But now that it was a reality---
Sebastian looked in the grimy mirror. 
The face there was thin 
and wan. * His skin was pale and haunted 
with shadows Sebastian knew was more 
than an affect of the bathroom's darkness 
and grime. *Knots of scars were beginning 
to creep up his neck and onto his cheeks. 
The person he used to be---the way things 
used to [[be]], seemed unattainably far away. [[ swap the order]]

"I was thinking, middle of nowhere," 
he heard her say. 

Sebastian dried his hands and stepped
out of the bathroom. Erika was waiting for him, 
using the moment to bathe in the warmth of the 
sunlight. 

"No where sounds good to me." [[ this section needs work. ]]

---

((And then this bit is already written))

(( Time for some deleted scenes ))

"No where is easy," Erika said as 
Sebastian drove. "No 
need for IDs and easier to avoid attention from 
the cult and people like them."

"Do you really think they'd still be after us?"

Erika shrugged. "It's hard to say. On one 
hand, Freeman's dead now. So are his main 
cronies, Keller and Grant. But Viletta and 
Gordon were still alive. And Sasha. It's hard 
to know what they'll do next. But to be safe, 
we should probably change vehicles, buy 
new clothes, and change our appearances."

"Do we really need to do all that?" Sebastian 
asked. 

"Probably not," Erika admitted. "But we 
should probably buy new clothes. Yours are 
covered in blood. Mine too."

So far they had avoided populous
both for Erika's preference and out of a 
practical desire to avoid attention. But Erika 
picked out a small town with a strip of small 
stores. At mid morning, it was abandoned. 

Erika parked the car, but sat still 
in the driver's seat. 

"What?" she said, giving Sebastian a 
glare. 

"Nothing!" said Sebastian, holding his 
hands up to wave away the 
accusation. 

"It's not nothing," she grumbled. 

"I'll tell you later," he said. 

Inside the store the employees paid 
them no mind beyond their automatic greeting. 
Banal pop music crooned over the store's 
tinny speakers. Sebastian stared at the 
arrays of clothing and colorfully dressed 
mannequins, feeling extremely out of place. 
Beside him Erika seemed equally uncomfort
able, rubbing at her 
bare arms as if cold. She was wearing 
only a black shift, having leant 
Sebastian her customary black 
turtleneck so he could have something to wear not 
covered in blood. 

Erika gave Sebastian a glare identical 
to the one he had received in the car, but 
said nothing a[[nd]] stalked off into the 
racks. Sebastian followed at a distance.

Sebastian watched Erika push 
through the rack of clothing, discarding most 
as soon as she set eyes on them. Sebastian 
sidled across the aisle to the men's section.

"Do---"

"What?" Erika barked, cutting Sebastian 
off. 

"Oh I was just going to ask if you had 
a favorite color."

"I wear black," she said flatly. 

"I can see that," Sebastian said. "But 
what's your favorite color?"

Erika rolled her eyes and turned her 
attention back to the rack. [[she's probably in a bad mood because of all the people around]] Sebastian smiled 
and went back picking out his own set 
of clothing. 

Silence save for the sound of Erika system
atically attacking the rack of sweaters. Then, 
after a moment,

"Purple," she blurted out. "I like the color
purple. But I don't wearing [[wear it]] it. 
I look like a grape."

"Mine is blue," said Sebastian. "I [[yellow]]
never wore it much either."

Sebastian went back to perusing the 
clothing, letting Erika stare at him in 
confusion. He could [[tell]] she was tempted to 
walk over to him to try and figure out what 
he was playing at, so he disappeared off 
to a distant corner of the store. 

Sebastian found himself a week's worth 
of clothing, and then added an extra set 
of undershirts and pants, antici
pating they wouldn't last long. Across the 
room, Sebastian saw Erika head to the 
fitting rooms with an armful of clothes, all 
black or brown. 

When she stepped out Sebastian 
was waiting for her. She looked at him 
suspiciously. 

"What do you want?" she asked. 

"I picked some things out for you," he 
said. He revealed a bundle from behind 
him. "Will you try them on?"

For a moment Erika looked at him 
incredulously. Sebastian was sure she
would refuse, but his disappointment changed 
her mind. 

"Sure," she grumbled "They're all purple, 
too, great."

She tried to hand her pile of clothing off 
to take his, but Sebastian resisted.

"If you do that you really will look like 
a grape. Here, try these ones, together." 
Sebastian sorted through the two piles of 
clothing, pulling out individual pieces 
for her to try. 

"It's just clothes," she muttered. 

"Clothing is a statement of self expression," 
he said. "I'm going to guess that 
self expression isn't 
something you've had much opportunity for."

"Killing people is self expression."

"Yes, but this is less morally wrong."

Erika grudgingly accepted 
Sebastian's curated outfit and retreated into 
the changing [[room]]. As she changed, Sebastian 
rifled through her clothing choices and his, 
handing her the next set as she finished 
with the first. It seemed that Erika wasn't 
willing to indulge his desire to see how 
she looked, but Sebastian didn't particularly 
mind. He would see them eventually. 

In the end Erika elected
to purchase only one of Sebastian's selected 
sweaters and a scarf---both of a 
similar dusty lilac color. 
It seemed that Erika was fond of only 
a particular shade of purple---something 
to keep in mind for the future. Also, 
the article had not managed 
to replace any of Erika's black clothing, 
only a particularly atrocious brown one 
Erika even admitted was obviously 
unfashionable. 

Purchases made, 
they walk[[ed]] back to the van. Sebastian 
through [[threw]] their bags into the back. 

"So, why were you in such a bad mood?" 
he asked. 

"Oh," she said. "Because you seemed 
to be pretty happy to be shopping, but 
I'm pretty sure I don't like shopping. I 
probably overcompensated. Sorry."

"Don't worry about it," said Sebastian 
cheerfully. "I actually really enjoy buying 
clothes. Before all this, I used to have a pretty impressive collection. A little embarrassing for a guy. This stuff isn't 
quite my usual style," he said, wrinkling
his nose. "But I think my tastes are too 
expensive for things I'll probably bleed through in a week."

"I wouldn't have guessed," Erika admitted. 
"You never seemed bothered by those hospital 
gowns they had you in 24/7." 

"Different priorities," Sebastian said. "But 
things are different yet again."

---

(( More superfluous scenes. I'm feeling fluffy today.))

"Flashlights, lighter, pain killers, bandages, 
iodine, toilet paper, toothpaste + brushes, 
anything else coming to mind?"

The next store down the line was a 
convenience store, similarly empty 
at midday. It seemed as good a time as any to 
stock up on essentials. 

Erika, with an armful of goods, came 
across Sebastian staring down the aisle 
of hair dye. 

"Were you being serious about changing 
our appearances?" he asked. 

"A little bit," she replied. "It couldn't 
hurt. We don't have to dye our hair 
though."
"It probably wouldn't survive it" Sebastian 
admitted. "It's not exactly in great shape."

"You do occasionally seem embarrassed 
about it. Why don't you 
cut it, now that you're out of prison?"

"Oh. Because it's falling out."

"What?"

"You haven't noticed?" Sebastian said, 
smiling. "It's not like I'm going bald 
or anything. It just falls out, in 
clumps. It's less noticeable when it's 
long."

[[ that was a low moment, when I realized ]]

"There's nothing wrong with being bald," 
said Erika, though she didn't look any 
less alarmed. "I used to be bald."

"You were?"

"Well, they shaved all my hair off. Better 
contact for electrodes."

"Oh. That sounds pretty bad."

Erika knodded [[ nodded]]. "Being bald was pretty 
bad," she agreed.

"Is that why you keep your hair long?"

"I guess so," she said. 

"Do you ever take it out of a pony 
tail?" he asked.
"Basically never," she said. "It's too much trouble 
otherwise."

"I see. I feel the same way, sometimes. 
Maybe I should try a pony tail too."

"I'll admit, that would be a little weird."

"It grows back, sometimes," Sebastian said, 
staring at the hair dyes again. "The hair 
that falls out. Just... white. My hair 
actually used to be the same color as yours."

"You're kidding, right?" she said, struggling to 
picture it.

"Yeah," he said, turning away from the 
hair dye. "It used to be 
just 
sort of brown. I almost like this better.

[[ the old section ]]

After three days of driving, they reached 
the coast. It was early down when 
they came across the sea, gray and 
endless. Sebastian pulled them into a 
nearby rest stop, parked the car, and 
sat down on the grassy hill to watch 
the waves crash beneath him. Erika 
joined him moments later. 

She handed him his coat, shrugging on 
her own before sitting down beside him.

"So we've run as far as we can," Sebastian 
said. The wind ran coldly through his clothes 
and hair, but it didn't seem to bother him. 

"In one direction. There's always 
north or south, even across the sea."

Sebastian looked out across the 
water, to where horizon blurred sea 
and sky. 

"Part of me feels like I'll never 
run far enough. That the cult 
will be coming for us, no matter where 
we go. We'll spend months and months 
running from them, and they'll find us 
again."


"Is this something you know?" Erika asked.

"No, it's something I'm scared of. But 
there is this."

Sebastian pulled his shoulder out 
from his shirt. Freshly bleeding, it said,

"It is the calm that brings the storm."

"So something is coming," Sebastian 
said. "It was wishful thinking that we'd 
be left alone forever."

Erika touched the 
flesh around the cut with a gloved hand.

"It's a little inflamed," she said. "We 
need to do a better job of cleaning 
your wounds."

"It's a little tough on the road," 
Sebastian agreed. 

"Come back into the van. We should 
cover that before it gets any worse."

Sebastian smiled to himself. 
Once a soldier always a soldier. He supposed 
that addressing the practical need was easiest 
for her. But he wondered 
what she was thinking. He knew that she 
could already tell what was on his mind. 
Listening to him voice his thoughts was just a courtesy to 
him. He wondered if she realized that it 
wasn't the same for him----until she 
chose to share it with him, he had no idea
what she was thinking. 

---

The weather grew rapidly colder 
as they traveled northward, a 
combination of the changing seasons 
and rising elevation. They made 
frequent stops to 
wait out torrents of rain 
and dangerous mountain roads, 
sitting side by side in silence 
as rain drummed loudly on the windows 
of their van.

Now that their sense of urgency had 
passed (Erika reassured Sebastian that 
she would let him know if she 
sensed anyone with any intention to pursue 
them) Erika stuck mostly to small mountain 
roads, distant from any sort of civilization. 
When S. drove, the small towns they passed they 
stopped to buy supplies before moving on. 
Erika would drive past without any mind. 

It was late afternoon when Sebastian 
awoke suddenly. The car was stopped, 
Erika was no where to be seen. They 
were at some small 
town. A few rows of houses, a general 
store, not much else. 


Sebastian shrugged on his coat and 
went to find Erika. He walked past 
the rows of houses, looking into their 
windows of yellow light. Families 
were home for the weekend, watching 
television, preparing dinner. Sebastian 
couldn't help but think of his own family, 
wondering if his parents [[aunt and uncle]] thought of him often. 
Did they even know he was no 
longer at Bedlam? He hoped that 
they still thought him there, in safe 
hands.

At the end of the street there was 
a tiny public library that doubled 
as a local tourism office. The 
lights were on inside. Sebastian 
pushed open the door and let himself 
inside.

Erika stood at the counter, speaking 
with a woman of at least 60. The 
library cum tourist information, Sebastian 
assumed. Erika gave him a nod 
and resumed her conversation 
at the counter. Sebastian nodded 
back and went to peruse the library's 
collection of books.

Sebastian scanned the bookshelves
for old favorites. He saw a substantial 
collection of classics, a smattering of 
obscure fiction he had never heard of 
before. The vast majority were the 
strange manuals and nonfiction that 
accumulate in abandoned 
bookshelves everywhere. 

Sebastian picked a book off the 
shelf at random and began to read, 
though he could[[n't]] help his attention being 
drawn to Erika's conversation.

"Is that your man? I see what 
you mean. And he's so young too. A 
bit of fresh him would do him a world 
of good."

"That's the plan, Ms. Grady."

"Oh, and he's so thin. You know what, 
forget about the rent. Just get that 
place fixed up and keep it in good shape. 
You're already doing us such a favor."

"You're too kind, Mrs. Grady. We'll 
take good care of it."

Erika came over to find him.

"The fishing birds of the Pacific 
Northwest? You didn't strike me as the 
wildlife kind."

"No, not really. What was all 
that about?"


"You wanted to settle down, didn't 
you?" she said, eyes twinkling. "Come with 
me."

Erika walked steadily back to the 
car. Sebastian jumped into the passenger 
seat after her. Erika threw him a 
local tourist map. 

"We're going to the place marked 
with an X."

Sebastian unfolded the map. It was 
an unremarkable map of the area. 
Someone had put in some half hearted 
effort to highlight the local attractions: 
a small lake, a smaller waterfall. 
The X Erika spoke of was a good 
distance away from both tourist 
attractions and town. 

"Is this a treasure map?" Sebastian 
asked, curiously. 

"There's an old cabin, two hours 
drive from here. A vacation home, but 
no one's used it in years. We can stay 
there for a bit, 
in exchange for keeping it up.
What do you think? No more sleeping 
in the car, no more gas station meals."

Erika pulled the car back onto a 
small unpaved road. Sebastian sat stunned 
in the passenger seat.

"Wow, I---"

"[[I figure]] we can stay here for the 
winter, move on in the spring 
or earlier if we get bored. Just rest 
our feet a little."

Sebastian looked over to Erika, 
still trying to process. She was 
smiling, a little nervous.

"What do you think? Do you like it? If not, we 
can just drive off 
and never come back."

Sebastian broke into a grin. "Yeah. 
A bed sounds magical."

Erika's relief was palpable. 

"You know, I never actually said 
anything about wanting to settle down."

"Downside to living with an 
Empath," she said. "You started resigning 
yourself to life on the road forever. I 
figure that you'd still like a place to stay, 
though 
it's hard to tell sometimes."

"You never said what you wanted
either. I thought you 
were happy to keep driving around forever."

Erika smiled, shaking her head. "I want 
what you want. I thought that was obvious."

---

Night had well and truly set in by 
the time they came to the end of the road. 
The cottage was a squat silhouette before 
the great shadows of the forest around 
them.

Erika tossed Sebastian the keys, and stood 
by his side as he unlocked the door. 
They used flashlights to inspect the inside. 
A fireplace, a cramped kitchen, 
shelves cramped with books and 
board games and linens. A couch, a 
bed. Huge windows overlooking 
the dark lake.

Sebastian wandered over to the windows, 
barely noticing as he stumbled over the 
cabin's uneven flooring and mismatched 
rugs. Above the lake, the stars glittered 
in a great stream above the still like. 

"The bed is all yours," said Erika. "I'll 
take the couch. In the morning we can 
see about the generator."

Sebastian didn't hear her, but she 
didn't mind. He was enrapt by the 
view of the stars, the lake, the forest. 
There were windows. It had been years 
since he'd had a window. 

Erika smiled to herself and curled 
up on the couch to fall asleep. She dreamt of 
Sebastian watching over a lake of 
stars. 

---

Erika woke up with the dawn. 
Sebastian slept like the 
dead on the bed across the room. 
Usually she caught 
fragments of strange dreams 
as he slept, but they seemed to have 
left him alone for the night. 

In the daylight there was much to 
want from the cabin. A smell of must 
pervaded the air---she would 
have to see whether the damp 
had progressed to mold. It was cramped, 
furniture a little too large for the space, 
which was filled with clutter. The 
doors and window frames fit poorly, 
warped by humidity and temperature. 

But Sebastian's immediate affection 
for the place made these problems seem 
fixable and small. 

Erika sighed and started on cleaning 
the place up.

---
[[ deleted ]]

[[ By some small miracle, the generator was still working. As the days were getting shorter, they probably wouldn't get much use of the solar panels, but they'd survive 

She walked back to the cabin. Sebastian was awake, cheerful. She opened the door and was greeted by a blast of warm air. She peered into the kitchen, where he had managed to turn on the propane stove and was using it to warm the remains of the gas station food. He'd gone through the cabin's accumulation of stuff and had fairly ruthlessly marked most of it to be thrown out.

"Did you get the power working already? I've got to step up my game. I'll go into town and get propane, food. Also drop off that box of stuff. You should look through and see if there's anything you want."

Sebastian watched out of the corner of his ]]

[[ Sebastian clung to sleep, trying to hold onto the confusion of that waking, where it was easy to forget where he was. It was 
an ingrained habit, using sleep to pass the time. Today, though, bright light cut through his fading dreams. Sunlight, he thought, and awoke."

That's right, he thought, drowsily. No more prison cells, no more guards.]]

But what now? No more 
driving, no more running. The last 
time he'd had the luxury of his own 
time, he'd been a student. Coursework, 
friends, ambition had driven him. 
Thinking into the future, in the coming 
years, nothing came to mind. He looked 
down at his arms. There were no 
answers there.

His mind touched briefly towards 
the words of the dreamwalker, 
but he quickly pushed them away.

There was a strange clicking 
sound from the ceiling. Sebastian looked 
up just in time to see the cabin's 
bare lightbulb flicker on. Erika must 
have gotten the electricity working. 

Sebastian pulled himself out of bed, 
Erika was probably in the same boat, 
but 
she'd already gotten the power up and running 
for the two of them. 

[[ there were practical matters to be addressed; it was easier to live for someone else than for yourself, ]]

The cabin was a mess and 
Sebastian didn't fancy living 
surrounded 
by reminders of a dead family he'd 
never met. At the moment the cabin 
didn't seem much bigger than his 
old prison cell, but he was sure that 
wouldn't be the case for long.

---

(( now the crossed out bit from pg 41))

Sebastian watched Erika out of the 
corner of his eye. Her glance slid 
off the pile of stuff, resting immediately
on an old hunting rifle Sebastian had 
leant against the box.

"Must have been a hunter," Sebastian 
said. "There's a bunch of dear skins 
and antlers in a shed in the back."

Erika picked it up, swung it open, 
looked down the sights. 

"Could come in useful," she said, 
and leant it against the wall.

---

Winter set in quickly after they 
arrived. After the first dusting of 
snow, Sebastian was glad they had 
managed to buy enough food to last 
them until the roads cleared, but 
as soon as they had, went back and 
properly stocked up on food and 
fuel. The townspeople were happy 
to provide wintering advice. Tire 
chains and canned goods consumed a 
good amount of money they had 
taken from the cult, but neither he 
nor Erika were concerned---they would 
address those problems when they got 
there.

Without much else to do, they 
worked through the laundry list
of repairs quickly. Come 
second snowfall, Erika had already 
refit all the doors and windows and 
patched the gaps in their 
walls. Sebastian rapidly found himself 
becoming master electrician trying 
to deal with the number of problems 
the cabin's various generators regularly put 
up. For a while it seemed the 
number of issues they had to deal 
with were endless, until suddenly, 
they were gone. 

Sebastian sat in his seat by the 
fire, book in his lap, but 
dozing more than reading. His 
attention drifted to Erika, seated 
on the window sill. She  had been 
attempting to carve something from a 
scrap of fire wood, but her hands were 
still now, her attention arrested by 
something out across the lake. 

"Do you hear that?" she said, suddenly. 

Sebastian listened, but heard nothing 
but the crackle of the fire. He stood, looking 
out over the lake, but there was no 
movement either.

"No, hear what?"

Erika looked up into Sebastian's eyes. 
He thought he saw a flicker of uncertainty.
"Nevermind," she said. "It was nothing."

Sebastian sat down next to her, 
taking care to put at least a foot 
between them. 

"Can I see what you're carving?'

Erika passed the thin disk of 
wood over. Sebastian turned it over in 
his hands. She had carved out the 
beginnings of a tree, its roots as 
long and thin as its branches. *

"It's something I saw once, in a dream."

There was a moment of silence. 
Both Erika and Sebastian remembered 
the cult's obsessions 
with Yggdrasil. 

He pushed such thoughts from his 
mind, though he knew she 
could hear them anyways. 

"It's beautiful," he said, handing it 
back to her. 

[[ bracketed ]]

Its branches were wild and run 
away and crowded against the 
edges of the charm. Its boughs 
bore heavy clusters of round fruit. Its
branches ended not in leaves, but instead 
split further and further until they were 
lost to the grain of the wood. 

[[unbracket]]

"I..." Erika's voice faltered, 
as if she were distracted by something 
in the distance. "
I'm going to take a walk, 
outside. Around the lake. Do you 
want to come with me?"

"Do you want me to?" Sebastian [[said]] 
looking out over the lake and shivering.

Erika shook her head. "I'll be back 
soon." She donned coat, hat, and 
boots and headed out into the cold. 

Sebastian grabbed his book and 
brought it to the window sill. As 
he read he would often stop to see if he 
could spot Erika in the shoreline, 
but there was no sign of 
her.

---

(( This scene goes before the previous. ))

Sebastian pulled up to the cabin, 
van fill[[ed]] with food, 
fuel, and a load of library books. 
Erika had declined to accompany
preferring to stay at the cabin 
and make progress on repairs. 

Sebastian began to unload the 
van. He took an armful 
of stuff into the cabin, but was 
surprised to see that Erika wasn't 
there. He stuck his head out the 
door, looking around. No sign 
of her outside either.

Sebastian was about to go around 
the grounds to look for 
her when he heard a low sound 
from up above him. He stepped 
back outside. 

Humming as she worked, Erika 
was on the roof, fastening the 
metal sheeting back down to 
the lumber [[beneath]].

Sebastian called out to her.

"Erika! you seem to be in a good 
mood today."

Blushing, Erika tried to disguise 
her humming into a cough, though 
Sebastian didn't buy it in the 
least. She could have seen 
and heard him from a mile
off, felt his presence from even farther. 

"If you want me to compliment your 
singing I can."

Erika cleared her throat. "I don't know 
what you're talking about. Also I don't 
always notice whether it's me or you
feeling the things I feel."

"I'm just kidding," said Sebastian. 
"It was nice, though. No need to 
be embarrassed."

"Hm. Well, thank you," she said 
gruffly, returning her attention to 
the roof.

"How's the view from up there?" 
he asked. 

Erika paused, 
turning her face upward into the 
sunlight. 

"It's beautiful," she said. "Nothing 
but forest and mountains as far as the 
eye can see. I can hear the wind, the birds. 
Not a soul for miles around. Even if 
I try, I can't feel anyone around for 
miles." She leant back onto the warm 
roof. "It's such a relief, to be alone 
at last."

"Except for me," said Sebastian, but 
Erika didn't seem to hear him.

---


The next day Erika headed out 
first thing after 
their breakfast. The day after that, 
at dawn. Soon, Sebastian became 
accustomed to waking up to 
an empty cabin and whiling away 
the hours until she returned, each day later 
and later [[later than the last]].

Really, he shouldn't have been so surprised 
when she stopped coming back at all.

At first, he had worried that she 
had hurt herself somewhere or was 
lost, but the 
pantry was missing several days worth 
of food, more than enough 
to make it to town and then beyond. 

In the end, though, he understood. At 
long last, she had achieved perfect solitude. 
No more thoughts and emotions 
of strangers crowding her head. He reflected 
on how in the days he had spent with 
her since leaving the cult, she seemed to 
have been becoming a different person
---more like herself. No doubt that this 
was the next step in the process. It 
was more surprising she 
hadn't left sooner. 

Still, he thought she'd at least have said goodbye. 

Sebastian chewed through his collection of 
library books, finding that even random 
accounts of history of their tiny town seemed 
interesting after rereading Antigone for the 
tenth time. When reading grew tiresome, he 
moved on to trying to sketch the frozen lake 
or whittle shapes into the firewood, 
but there was little to do that didn't remind 
him of Erika. He 
began to 
plot out his plan to leave in the spring. [[ shape his plan?]]

A day especially cold and snowy, Sebastian 
sat close to the fire, bundled in blankets. 
He did his best to block out any openings 
for the heat to escape, but still couldn't 
manage to keep the room warm. He was 
resigned [[resigned himself to]] to staying up the night to 
keep the fire through the night.

He was drifting between sleep and 
wakefulness, his mind empty save for 
the sound of fire in his ears. A 
crunching sound did little 
to shake him from his daze, but when it 
was followed by another, then another, he 
threw the blankets off him.

One of the villagers come to check on him? 
Or some wild animal? Or, Sebastian swallowed, 
the cult, come to take him back
The night was bright with light 
reflected from the snow. Sebastian saw 
the figure in the distance, hulking and 
indistinct. 

Nervously, Sebastian looked around for 
the rifle, but couldn't find it. Had Erika 
taken it?

Sebastian pulled his hat and gloves 
on. It was unlikely to be a villager, 
out on a night like this. The figure 
was clearly not an animal either. 
Best to take what he could and run. 
He grabbed what remained of 
the cultist's money and prepared to 
brave the snow. 

Sebastian pushed open the door, 
flinching through the gust of cold wind and 
snow. 

The figure was only a few feet away. 
In the light of the cabin, it resolved itself 
into Erika, with a deer across her 
back.

"Surprised to see me?" she said. "You're 
always so quick to write me off."

Sebastian stood agape with surprise 
as Erika shrugged the deer off her 
shoulders into the snow. Shaking the snow 
from her coat, she stepped into the 
cabin. 
She stretched out her arms, 
unknotting her shoulders and soaking 
in the warmth.

"Where did you go?" Sebastian said, 
finally finding his voice.

"Hunting," she said beaming. "
I was just walking through the 
woods at first, trying to clear 
my head. But my mind kept wandering, 
like I was hearing things even though 
no one was there. But I started following 
tracks in the snow, and when I sat there, 
watching and waiting in the snow, it 
was like the whole world faded out. It 
was so quiet. I could finally hear 
myself think."

"And you killed a deer?" 

"Well, you were getting tired of canned 
beans day in day out. Me too."

Sebastian shook his head, but was 
smiling nonetheless. "You must be exhausted. 
And freezing. I'll get some water 
heated up."

"No, it's fine. I can wait until morning. 
I feel like I could sleep for a thousand years."

"Take the bed then. I may or may not 
have cleared your stuff off the couch."

Erika shed her coats [[coat]] and boots and collapsed 
into the bed. She laid on her 
back, watching the field of stars [[out]] the 
window.

"You didn't have to come back," Sebastian 
said, quietly.

Erika turned to look up at 
him. "Why wouldn't I?"

"It's just---you can be yourself now---
by yourself."

Erika turned back around, hiding her 
face.

"It just wouldn't feel right without you."

Erika fell still, presumably 
asleep. Sebastian sat down 
by the fire, lost in thought. 

---

Erika woke up just before noon, 
blinking heavy sleep from her eyes. 
Sunlight streamed in from the windows. 
Sebastian was already gone.

Erika washed the grime of several 
days off her skin, then got dressed 
and went outside. She could tell that 
Sebastian wasn't anywhere nearby, 
[[but]] checked anyways.

Outside, their van was gone. He 
must have wanted to take advantage
of the good weather to restock.

She was a little disappointed that he 
wasn't around. She went down to the lake 
to wait for him to come back.

On the lakeside, she fished for stones 
to skip, though instead of skipping 
they skidding across its frozen 
surface. Erika dusted off a 
snow covered rock, sitting down to 
face the open lake.

Restlessness only let her enjoy the view 
for a moment. The urge to wander was 
strong, like an external force. But Erika was 
accustomed to sensations from 
outside of her own mind. She pushed 
the urges aside and forced herself to 
settle down. Uneasily, she drifted 
off to a half sleep. 

A strange thwack sound woke her, 
followed by a wave of disgust. Erika, 
disoriented, stood and stretched the 
kinks from her legs. It was 
just past noon. Sebastian was back, 
and not happy about something. 

She found him in the 
hunter's shed they had mostly ignored 
until now, arms deep in deer guts.


He had, with moderate success, removed 
its skin and was beginning the 
pleasant process of gutting it.

"What...what are you doing?" 
Erika asked. She tried 
not to let Sebastian's disgust 
turn her own stomach.

"Oh, there you are," he said, 
putting on a cheerful voice. "Clearly 
I am butchering a deer. Yes, I 
am just as surprised as you are, but 
here we are. If you told me a 
year ago that in a 
year's time I'd be standing here, 
up to my elbows in deer offal, 
well, I guess I'd be pretty 
happy about it since that means I'd be out of 
Bedlam, but still."

Sebastian had found an extremely 
menacing knife and was waving 
it indistinctly as he tried to follow 
a plastic wrapped print out of an 
illustrated guide of how to butcher 
a deer. 

"But...why?"

"Because I thought you'd be 
less of a homicidal maniac once 
we got away from the cultists, but 
apparently not. Though instead of killing 
people you've moved on to animals, which 
is a bit of an improvement. And if 
you're going to kill for sport, far be 
it from me to let it go to waste."

"No, I mean, why are you butchering 
it? I was happy to do it myself."

Sebastian set down the knife. "Oh. 
Somehow I got in my head that 
I wanted to do it for you. I mean, you 
brutalize people on a regular basis. 
I thought, how hard could it be? Clearly 
I was wrong. This is gross."

Despite Sebastian's vitriol [[complaints]], Erika 
could tell there was no anger behind 
it. His chattiness belied his happiness 
to have her back. 

"Butchering is definitely grosser than 
just shooting people," she said. "
But you've 
just go to push it back. Is there 
anything I can help with?"

"Just hold up the [[instructions]]. According 
to the instructions I'm done with the 
grossest part. No swooping in now that 
the hardest part is done."

Erika laughed heartily. Sebastian 
smiled through the grime of deer, 
happy to have her back.

---

They fried the best cuts of deer on 
a pan over an open fire, 
and washed them down with the 
cheap beer Sebastian had bought at 
the town's general store. Halfway 
through the evening, the power died, 
but their bellies were too full with 
warm food to venture out into the 
cold to fix it.

Sebastian sat by the fire, squinting 
to read in the flickering light. 
Erika lounged on the couch, watching 
him.

Sebastian looked up, seeing Erika 
staring at him. Her eyes, dark, flickered 
with reflections from the fire. 

"What are you thinking about?" he 
asked.

Erika took a moment to answer, 
as if carefully sorting [[sifting]] through her thoughts.


"I was thinking, that I liked listening to 
you read," she said. "Catching snippets 
of thoughts---your and the characters. 
Different every time."

"Hmm," Sebastian hummed, turning 
back to his book, though he could barely 
see it He could feel her attention on 
him.

"Sebastian," she said after 
a moment.

"Yes?" he said, pretending to stop 
reading.

"Your bandages---did you change 
them while I was gone?"

"I did. Though maybe not as often 
as I should have. Why do you ask?"

"No reason," she said. "Do they 
need to be changed now?"

Sebastian thought about it. The 
marks on his back hadn't bothered him 
for a while, but that was no excuse 
to be lazy about it.

"Sure."

"Let me grab my gloves," Erika said, 
rising from the couch.

Sebastian stole her spot on the couch
. He pulled off his shirt, inspecting 
it for unexpected stains.
Erika sat down behind him and 
began to unwind his bandages, exposing 
patches of skin to the cold. He shivered 
involuntarily, but she was quick 
to rebandage what she had undone. 
Her hands were warm on his back.

"Anywhere else?" she asked 
as he redressed. 

"No," he said. "What about you? 
I thought I saw you limped earlier."

"Just a scrape," she said. "I can 
take care of it later."

Sebastian shook his head. "No, 
let me. Give me your gloves."

"It's fine---!" she protested, but 
Sebastian reached out and grabbed her 
gloved hand. She froze, looked up at 
him confused. 

Careful not to touch her skin, he 
slid the gloves from her fingers. She 
didn't resist and let him pull them 
over his own hands.

He knelt down in front of her. 
She 
watched him fold up the leg of her pants, 
all to aware of the brush of his gloved 
fingers against skin.


Carefully, he wiped her scraped 
skin with a damp cloth, dried it and wrapped 
it up with bandages. 
Each touch was as careful and deliberate 
as when she had first 
done the same for him.

"Sebastian?" she asked, as he finished. 
His mind was blank, his expression 
unreadable.

[[ Though his movements were steady, his mind was as confused as she was. ]]

The skin of her leg was warm. Her 
calves were thick with muscle. The 
scrape on her skin seemed barely more 
than a blemish, compared to his, 
where the cuts on his arms and legs 
seemed to subsume any substance. 

He touched her skin, feeling its warmth 
through the gloves. Gently, he dragged his 
fingers along her calf, into the soft [[skin]] beneath 
her knee.

"Sebastian?" she repeated. He looked up 
at her. Her face was a mix of confusion and 
concern. "What are you doing?" [[ Even though he himself did not know. ]]
"Before I met you, everything seemed 
in a fog," he said. "Years of my life 
passed, and I didn't even care. But then, 
when I saw you, it was like the entire 
world came into clarity, became real 
again. When I think back to then, 
I get scared, of how little I cared. I'd 
do anything, to never go back 
to how things were before you."

Sebastian stood. Erika was about 
to say something, but he caught her, 
reaching out to touch her 
face. The words caught in her throat. 
He ran his fingers along her 
cheek, over her temple, into 
her hair. Her 
eyes were wide, startled. In the firelight 
they seemed to glow. He stepped away.

"You don't have to say anything," he 
said. "Tell me what you think, later, 
when I'm not around."

Sebastian made to take his place 
by the fire, but Erika grabbed him
by the sleeve, bare skin only 
inches from his.

"Go ahead," she said.

"What do you mean?"

"You want to touch me, don't you? 
Go ahead. I don't mind."

Sebastian's expression was blank, 
conflicted and confused. His heart beat 
wildly in his chest, as it did in Erika's. 

"It won't kill me, if that's what you're 
worried about / You've done it before," 
she said, trying not to squirm under 
his gaze. Embarrassment rose to her 
cheeks unbidden.

"Are you sure?"

"I trust you," she replied, steadily.

She pulled Sebastian closer, pulling the gloves 
off his hands just as he had removed them 
from her earlier. She raised his hand up 
to her face.

Tentatively, Sebastian touched two 
fingers to the side of her face. There was 
no flash, no spark of electricity, just 
the warmth of her skin. But then he looked into 
her eyes, and there was nothing there---
only himself, looking back. [[ seeing himself should be something he said. ]]

He jerked his hands back. Erika blinked
as she came back to. [[ she saw the look of horror on Sebastian's face ]]

"What happened?"

Sebastian rubbed his fingers together, 
still shocked. 

"It was uncomfortable. 
It was like you weren't [[there at all]] gone."

Erika smiled ruefully. "I 
should have known. It's 
strange, isn't 
it? They used to do experiments where they 
had someone hold onto me for weeks 
at a time. The kind of person 
who could look into my eyes and 
see nothing there for weeks straight..." 
Erika trailed off. "But you're nothing like 
that. It makes me glad, but at the 
same time..."

Sebastian sat down next to 
Erika. She noted the extra care he took 
to sit apart from her.

"I know how you feel, Sebastian. 
The touch made sure of that. You want 
me know if I [[you want to know if]] feel the same way about you, 
and not just because
of the way you feel about me. But I 
can't answer 
that question. What do I feel without you? 
I don't know. I don't know if I feel 
anything at all. [ Before the cult, I was only 
myself for minutes at a time, blinking 
in and out of existence, with hands all 
over me, all the time. And at the 
cult I wasn't much more than a human 
weapon---it's all I wanted to be. Now 
that I'm with you, I don't know what 
to do.]

Erika put her gloves back on and wrapped 
the blanket around herself. 

"But at the same time, alone here, 
with you, is the happiest 
I've ever been. [[ It's the first time I'm happy as I am.]] And I'll 
do whatever I can to keep it that way."

Erika curled up on the couch to 
watch the fire until she fell asleep. 
She expected Sebastian to return to his 
bed to do the same, but he never did. Just
pulled his own blankets from the couch 
and fell asleep sitting next to her.

---

The next morning, Erika awoke before 
Sebastian. She tried to leave the couch 
without waking him, but he started 
away as soon as she shifted  [[unintelligible]].
"I'm sorry," he stammered. "During the night
---did I?"

Erika shook her head. "It's fine."

They went about their morning routine, 
washing, making breakfast. After they 
ate, Sebastian went out to repair the 
generator. Erika stayed in, thinking 
about the night before. She touched 
her fingers to her temple. She remembered 
both the feeling of Sebastian's fingers 
on her skin, her skin on her Sebastian's 
fingers. [[though one better than the other]]

Sebastian let himself in with a blast 
of cold air. Erika shook herself 
out of her reverie.

"With all this warmer 
weather, spring is probably around the 
corner. I've been thinking, if we 
wanted, we could probably grow our 
own food, for the next winter instead
of buying all this canned stuff. And we 
could salt and dry the meat, sell the 
rest."

Sebastian kept his voice even, but 
knew Erika could feel him hoping for her 
approval.

"Yeah," she said. "We could do that."

(( At this pt. S. should have visions 
and messages about the end. )) [[ this is the foreshadowing act ]]

[[ This entire section should probably be deleted, but I'll keep it for reference.

"I'm going to get started on the beans. are you going to come?"

There was a muffled sound from the bed, but otherwise no response. Erika gave Sebastian a moment to wake up properly, but even then he didn't reply.

"Sebastian?"

"Sorry," he said into the pillows. "I'm not really in the mood today."

Only a fan of gray hair was visible from beneath the blankets. Of late it was rare for Erika to see any more of him than that.

"You'll at least come sit outside with me, won't you?"

Under the covers, Sebastian hesitated. Previous days she'd accepted the excuse and moved on.

"Yeah," he said. "Just give me a moment."

"I'll be outside, if you need me," she said. 

Once she was gone, Sebastian wormed his way out from under the covers. He'd had terrible dreams--a vision of an all engulfing flood, hallways through non euclidean surfaces, Freeman's gaping mouth, and of course, the binding winds of the stone tableau. The dreams elided past and future and left him confused and exhausted into the waking hours, enforcing their influence by a growing number of incisions on his skin.

Though his body protested every move, he rolled out of bed and went to rummage through the medicine cabinet. A wave of dizziness made it hard to coordinate his eyes and hands to grab what he was looking for. As soon as he grabbed bandages and pain killers he collapsed back onto the bed. 

(( and now the stuff written before, but with less internal reflection. ))

Sebastian sat back down on the bed to wait for his vision to 
stop swimming. It scared him, how quickly he had grown so weak. Though he had tried to hide it from her, there was no way Erika wasn't aware that was his real reason for leaving the care of the cabin to her alone. 

But, butter to disguise one fear beneath another. Sebastian gulped down the pain killers before touching his hand gingerly to the wound on his chest. By now it was several days old, still seeped slowly into the bandages. Sebastian rebound them as quickly as he could without looking down at the message.
Somehow even the effort to covertly rebandage himself left him feeling winded and weak. It would be so much easier to stay inside and fake exhaustion disguised as disinterest, even if it were only a skin deep lie. But even Erika got lonely sometimes, it seemed. 

Sebastian steeled himself and rose from the bed. With a hand against the wall to steady himself, he dressed an made his way to door, pausing to catch his breath before pushing it open.

When he did, Erika was waiting outside for him. Without a word,she braced herself under his arm and brought him to the bench outside a word. ]]

---

(( Bleh, try again. ))

"Sorry, I...got to sit down for a minute. 
You don't mind do you?" "Of course not."

Sebastian walked over to the bench outside 
their cabin, trying to minimize 
the limp in his step. Erika said nothing as 
he collapsed onto the bench, chest heaving.

"That's the green beans done," 
he said, shielding his eyes from the sun 
as he looked up to the sky. "It took 
longer than I thought. Maybe we should 
skip out on the turnips."

"Really?" said Erika, balancing 
on the handle of the hoe. "You 
were adamant that we get the seeds."

"That was just because Mrs. Grady 
insisted there'd be a great harvest this 
year. I don't actually even like 
turnips."

Erika smiled wickedly. "No need 
to try and please Mrs. Grady, she's 
plenty pleased with the fresh blood 
for her weekly gossips with the twins. 
The fact we haven't done anything 
gossip worthy hasn't 
even slowed her down."

"Mrs. Grady? No way."

"Not quite the grandmotherly old lady 
you thought," said Erika. "Since 
no one's ever showed up to take her 
place she's been the neighborhood 
socialite for near 40 years now."

"What sort of things are they saying 

about us?"

"Do you really want to know?"

"Well, now I'm not sure."

"Well, apparently 
I'm [[some]] sort of ruined woman, feeling 
my shameful past, and abusing you and 
your kindness by stealing you from your 
family."

Sebastian winced. Erika laughed. 
"They're not entirely wrong on that one," she said. 

"You know, if you were friendlier to 
them, they'd probably think a little 
better of you."

"I'm aware, but every likes a villain 
in their otherwise boring lives."

"Alright then, what about me?" Sebastian 
said, preparing for the worst.

"They think you're a spy."

"You're kidding."

"Nope."

Sebastian groaned. "Someone's been 
watching too much James Bond."


"Apparently you've received a deadly dose 
of radiation and retired early to the 
Pacific Northwest. Opinions are divided 
on whether I'm the hardened veteran's 
last chance at finding love or some 
harpy after your generous government 
pension."

Sebastian wondered if he could 
go blind from his rolling his eyes too hard.

"Let's switch jobs. You can be the 
secret agent and I'll be the floozy. 
Because last time I tried being a spy that 
went so well."

"I do have the better resume for it," 
she agreed. "But I doubt you'll be able 
to convince the neighborhood gossips 
that. You should embrace your 
alternate ego. Give Mrs. Grady a 
knowing wink next time you see her. 
It'll make her day."

"God, no, the 
last thing I want is to encourage them."

"Then I can give them some 
new rumors to distract them, if 
you'd like," she said, smiling shark like. 
"Empath's guarantee to be true."

"Definitely not," Sebastian said flatly.
"[[ Please ]] try to use your powers for good, instead of 
evil."

Erika chuckled. "What about you? You aren't 
exactly superman either."

"I don't think my 'powers' are useful enough 
to have to make that kind of decision," said 
Sebastian. "Though I'd like to think I'd 
choose to what's right, when I can."

Erika bent over and went 
back to trying to break up a new row of 
soil for the next set of crops. With the 
warming weather and the exercise 
combined, she was grateful for the slight 
breeze, though Sebastian shivered through it 
next to her.

"You know, it's funny. 
Back when I was just like 
everybody else, I was so unafraid of the 
future, event though I knew nothing about it. 
I had it all mapped out, from school to 
retirement. But these days, even 
just planting some seeds for harvest
later this spring, somehow it seems 
so hard." ((scared of something going wrong ))

Erika watched Sebastian stare off into 
the distance, thoughts churning shapelessly 
just beyond her reach.

"Sometimes it's best to take these things 
day by day," she said. "Normally I'm 
against that sort of thing, but it doesn't 
seem so bad, when you're 
happy with the way things are."

"Are you happy with the way things 
are?"

"I think so," she said. 

"What a coincidence,' he said, 
smiling. "Me too."

---

"The potatoes might be ready today," 
Erika said. "Will you come with me to check?"

There was a muffled sound from 
the bed, but otherwise no response. Erika gave 
Sebastian a moment to wake up fully, but 
even then there was no reply.

"Sebastian?"

"Sorry," he said
into the pillows. All
she could see of him was a fan of gray 
hair splayed out across the pillow. "I'm 
just not in the mood. Not today."

So it had been for several weeks. Sebastian's health had deteriorated rapidly. What started as only a lingering fatigue quickly became an unshakable exhaustion. Terrible dreams, of a flood, of Freeman's lifeless face, of the stone tableau, troubled his sleep, and extended their influence into his waking hours by inflicting new wounds on to his weakening body.

These days all Sebastian could manage was to covertly change his bandages while Erika was out of cabin. 
Even though it was obvious that 
his disinterest was 
faked, usually Erika would oblige 
him and leave him alone for the day. But 
not today. Even beneath the covers, 
Sebastian felt the hairs on his neck 
raise from her gaze.

She ripped the covers off him. Sebastian 
attempted in vain to grab them back, 
but the movement sent 
stabs of pain through his muscles.

"It smells like blood in here, Sebastian," 
she said. Her face was twisted with worry. 
"How long [[did you intend for]] can this go on for?"

Sebastian's eyes were wide with fright. 
He tried to cover himself with his hands, 
but there was no hiding the multitude of 
new wounds, poorly bandaged and seeping 
blood into the sheets.
"I---" he stammered. "I just wanted---"

"What was the plan, Sebastian?" she said, dropping the blankets. "To just push me away until I just come back to a corpse on the bed?"

She knelt down on the bed and reached to the largest of the wounds on Sebastian's chest, where the bandages were pink and damp. He scrabbled back on the bed.

"No---don't. I never meant for it to be for long. I just---"


Erika forced her hand against his forehead. Even through her gloves


she could feel the heat of his skin. 

"You're feverish. How could you let this happen?"

Erika grabbed Sebastian by the shoulder, forcing him to look at him.

"I---I thought it would be fine---I thought I could take care of it."

Erika stepped back. Delirious fever thoughts rolled through his head, blending irrationalities from both dreams and reality. Now, at a distance, Erika was almost shocked to see him look so small. He was afraid,  she realized. That was the feeling twisting up through her gut. 

Her expression softened. "Will you let me see?'


The sudden tenderness of her expression seemed to surprise him. He calmed.

"I never meant to let it get so out of hand."

As soon as she was unstuck the first of the tape, a foul stench filled the air. Sebastian panicked again, pushing her hand away from him. 

"You can't---you can't read it. Promise me that you won't."

"I need to see if it's infected," she said.

"I know, just---promise me you won't try to read it."

Sebastian bit his lip to keep from crying out as the bandages came away, pulling and sucking at the skin. The skin was inflamed, weeping equal parts pus and blood. Sebastian's hands hovered over the wound, obscuring the whole of the message. Erika gently nudged his hands away to inspect the wound.

"It won't stop bleeding," he said, tears coming to his eyes. "It's been weeks but it won't heal."
Erika's face was expressionless. 
Even as 
she looked at the wound, 
mottled 
with inflammation and stinking, 
there was no change. No sign 
of whether she had read the message 
inscribed in the infected flesh. 
Nervously, Sebastian covered the 
skin with his hands.

"It's badly infected," she said, quietly. 
"We'll...have to go to a hospital."

Her voice was heavy. Sebastian felt 
his heart sink, but he knew she was 
right.

He pressed his face into his hands 
and felt tears break out from between 
his fingers. Across his body, half hidden 
by yellowing bandages his wounds 
seemed to burn. 

"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm sorry."
"There's nothing to be sorry for," Erika 
said softly. "I'll pack our things 
and then we can go."

---

"It looks like he'll be alright. We'll 
have to keep him at the hospital 
to make sure the infection doesn't 
progress to sepsis, but he's responding 
well to antibiotics. Any later would 
have been dangerous."

Erika nodded, listening more to 
the doctor's cool tone than to the words 
themselves. Sebastian was asleep on 
the bed beside her, looking dangerously 
frail hooked up to an IV.

They had come to the small town's 
doctor late in the day. The occupants 
of the waiting room, families waiting 
for their own appointments, 
had seemed shocked to see 
her come in, Sebastian 
draped over her shoulder, barely able
stand. During the long drive over his 
fever had only worsened, to the point where 
Erika had to move him to the back of 
the van to remain coherent herself. There 
was no delay in getting Sebastian to the 
doctor's care.

Now that she was of clearer mind, 
she regretted how hastily had she [[ she had]] brought 
Sebastian in. Too many people had seen 
them; word would spread quickly of the 
man 
with words carved in his skin.

There was some worry on the doctor's 
attention beyond professional care concern [[delete]]. 
Erika had been hoping to avoid this 
conversation.

"You wouldn't believe me if I told you," 
she said, just as the doctor's opened 
his mouth to speak. 

"Sorry," he said instead, surprised.

"Where the wounds came from. 
It would be better if you didn't ask."

The doctor angered. "I have a duty 
of care to my patients. If this was 
self inflicted we need to put him in a 
psychiatric hold. If someone else did this 
then I am mandated to 
report this to the police."

Erika ignored his obvious suspicion 
towards her. "That's why I said it's 
better you don't ask. The truth 
is that neither of those are the case."

"Are you trying to suggest this was anything 
but a deliberate act of cruelty---and it's been 
going on for years. The scar tissue---"

"I know," she said. "It's cruel, but 
it's nothing that the police or a psychiatric 
hold [[ psychiatrist]] can prevent. I don't know if there's 
anything in the world that can stop this 
from happening to him."

Desperately she wished she could muster 
up the sadness that those words conveyed. 
But all she had was the doctor's skepticism 
and Sebastian's troubled dreams.

"Doctor," she said, again cutting him 
off before he could speak. "The wound 
on his chest, it wouldn't stop 
bleeding."

"Yes," he said, slipping back into 
the comfortable role of medical
expert. "A few of the other wounds as well. It was very odd--like some 
form of localized hemophilia. 
Some venoms can cause similar symptoms 
but the wounds are obviously not some 
kind of bite or sting..."

"It's strange, isn't it? But there are 
far stranger things out there. 
What caused the wounds is one of them."

The doctor shook his head. "I'll 
still have to report this to the police 
anyways. [[delete anyways]]"

"Will you wait until he wakes up first?" 
she said. "He...might be able 
to tell you what really happened."

Erika flinched as the Doctor patted her 
shoulder, in spite of his lingering 
suspicions. 

"He'll be awake soon," he said. 
"I'll have someone bring you a chair."

---

Sebastian pressed a hand against the 
stone of the gate, watching the way the 
flesh of his hand flattened against it, 
the way it seemed so solid and concrete 
beneath his fingers, in a way 
that lately reality had not.

The freezing winds of the wasteland 
still howled about him but Sebastian 
barely noticed. The cold and bite 
instead seemed to pass through him, as 
if his body were nothing more than 
a net of its scars. 

"Dreamwalker, are you here?"

"I am," she said, 
this time borrowing the appearance 
of his aunt. Sebastian would have expected 
the sight of her face to 
surprise him, but 
somehow seeing here again atop the stone 
bluff meant nothing to him.

"You've been watching my dreams, still?" 
he asked.

"I have," he said [[she]]. 

"Then why is this happening, dreamwalker?" he 
said, turning around. There were tears 
in his eyes. "Why does this have to 
happen? How do I tell her that she has 
to die?"

In dreams he carried his wounds, 
but free of blood and infection, the 
words gaped like red mouths 
carved into his skin. The wound on his 
chest, unmarred by infection or the 
process of healing read,

(( Bleh, prophecies are annoying 
to write, they need a consistent style))

((But something extended that describes how 
Erika will return to the world tree and 
obliterate all consciousness))

"There are so many of them," Sebastian 
said, shivering. 
"At first I thought that maybe that I was mistaken, 
but as more and more of them started to 
appear, there was no way I could 
deny it... And just when I thought things 
were finally going to work out..."

(( too show don't tell-y))

Sebastian slammed a fist against the stone 
gate. It resounded echoingly but did not 
budge. 


"One thing is clear," the dreamwalker said. 
"Things are coming to an 
end soon for you. The dreams, the new 
prophecies, the new words---the arrival of the Deva 
birthright has already happened. All 
that[['s]] left is to embrace it."

"Is that why I've been feeling so weak 
lately?" 

"I imagine that your body is at war. 
Your physical self is incompatible with 
the transcendental nature of the Deva. 
At this point, things won't get better."

"I thought we would have more time," 
he said. "But I guess that's 
not true. I just feel like we didn't have 
enough."

---

Sebastian awoke to find [[ Erika asleep]] 
at the side of his bed, head 
crooked at an uncomfortable angle in her 
sleep. It was a welcome change of pace 
from his usual hospital awakenings.

She stirred and woke quickly after 
he did. There were dark bags beneath 
her eyes. She grimaced and straightened 
out the kinks in her neck.


"Good morning, I think," he said. 

"More like good night," she 
said. 'It's 8 o'clock. How are you 
feeling?"

[[ staunchly quiet. Clock ticking, dogs barking in the distance. Sounds are far away, dreamlike. To her it was probably raucously loud, compared to their home in the woods.]]

"Better,"said Sebastian. It was 
difficult to recall 
the last thing he could remember 
from being awake. 
The muddle of dreams made it seem 
so far away. But he felt less desperately 
tired now, a little like he was 
moments away from falling to pieces.

"A little like Frankenstein," he  added, 
craning his chest to see a sea of stitches 
through the prophecies. "How long have 
I been here?"

"Only a day or so," she said. "We 
can stay a little longer, if you need to."

"I see," said Sebastian. 
He pushed himself upright 
as a test. Every inch of him 
protested, but that was nothing knew. 

[[ maybe S. calls the foundation, knows he can't stop Erika himself? ]]
"Listen, Erika, while I was out, did 
you read---"

"The dreams you've been having, Sebastian, 
about the flood...." she trailed off.

"I didn't," she said, looking away. 
"But your dreams, the ones about the 
tree---"

Sebastian wondered at the lines of 
worry in her face. No doubt similar lines 
had crossed his at some point. But in 
the end, what was the point of such 
worry and grief? His ailing health, 
her dire fate, 
[[nothing]] could be done about them. 
And was there 
anything Erika detested more than 
worrying pointlessly?

"Come close, Erika. I have a 
secret to tell you," he said. "A 
secret dream."

Erika, a little confused, leaned 
over the bed. Careful not to touch her, 
Sebastian whispered in her ear.

As he spoke her frown deepened, 
then disappeared. His story went on until 
the tension left her 
shoulders, and a smile began to trace 
her face.

"That's ridiculous," she said, sadly 
but still smiling.

"So then don't worry, Erika," said Sebastian, 
leaning back to the bed. "Not all of my 
dreams come true."

---

I had a dream that the 
cult, the foundation, the whole 
world forgot about us. That 
we could go wherever we wanted, do whatever 
we wanted. So we traveled the world. 
We saw mountains and rivers and craters 
and lagoons and deserts until we grew 
tired and old. You turned gray, I 
went bald. We bickered, we fought. 
We grew comfortable with each other, and 
complacent. We fell out and into 
love. We weren't right for each 
other, but we stayed anyways [[all the same]].

And then, one day, in one of those long 
months where the only way we could stand 
to be around each other was to pretend that 
the other didn't exist, it all fell away---
all the reasons we had to hate each other 
after a lifetime together. I took you back 
here, to our first home together. We walked 
around the lake, sat under the stars. Then, 
I made you say goodbye to me. You hesitated, 
then you agreed. I did the same.

In the morning you were dead. And 
after only a few days of grief, I the same.

So then don't worry, Erika. Not all 
of my dreams come true.

---

Sebastian insisted that he was well 
enough to travel, so Erika distracted 
the nurse and snuck him out 
unwatched. With any luck,
no one would notice they 
had left until the morning.

They sat motionless in the 
car for several moments, 
neither willing to break the 
silence or to start the drive.

"What...what's the date?" Sebastian 
blurted out suddenly.

"March 3rd,"  she said. "Why do 
you ask?"

"It's been almost a year since I'
ve been out of Bedlam," he said. "That 
means it's been a year since I've met 
you. When is your birthday?"

"My birthday? I haven't thought about 
that in ages. To be honest, I've forgotten. 
Some time in the spring, I think?"

"Then how do you keep track
of how old you are? How old are you 
anyways?

"Twenty two. Maybe twenty three 
at this point."

"Really? I thought for sure you were 
older than me."

"I'll take that as a compliment, I 
think?'

"Well, mine is March 11th. You can 
borrow mine, if you'd like."

Erika stared straight ahead, 
seeing nothing in the dark. But Sebastian 
imagined even in this tiny town 
the night was very loud to her.

"Well, then, Sebastian. Where would 
you like to spend your birthday?'

Sebastian looked down at his hands. 
They looked 
strange and brittle in the fluorescent 
glow of the streetlamps, and though 
he was sheltered from the elements 
in their car, there was a shiver 
he couldn't seem to shake off. 

"Home," he said. "I want to go home."

---


They decided to make a stop over in 
the village to pick up some 
supplies before heading back home.

(( They should know the Foundation 
is coming for them from S's))

Erika loaded up the car, letting Sebastian 
chat up the general store's owner 
while he paid. She 
couldn't decide 
whether he was in a good mood or 
not, as he laughed and joked with 
the shopkeeper. Her own chest 
felt heavy with resignation.

A note of surprise caught her attention 
from across the street. She looked up from 
their groceries just in time to see Mrs. 
Grady hurry into the village's 
only bar.

"That wasn't nearly as hard on the 
wallet as I thought," said Sebastian, 
struggling a little under the last load of 
their groceries. "Do you want to go 
spend the rest at the Gorge?"
[[ deleted. Though I can't remember why, just going to type it out anyways

 "Great idea," growled Erika, taking Sebastian's bags and throwing them into the truck. She slammed the door shut and stalked over to the restaurant. Sebastian followed, puzzled.

The Gorge, doubling as the town's restaurant and bar, did a modest trade on the weekends, with most of the town's few dozen residents stopping by to enjoy a drink or staticky tune on the bar's aging phonograph. It was yet early for the majority of the weekend crowd, but a handful of the regulars were already at the bar. 

Heads turned as Erika and Sebastian let themselves in, among them Mrs. Grady, who seemed mildly alarmed. 

"Go ahead and sit down," Erika murmured to Sebastian, flicking her eyes over to the nearest table. Sebastian complied, curious.

Erika stayed by the exit instead. ]]

of following Sebastian to the table. Mrs. Grady pulled away from the bar.

"Leaving so soon, Mrs. Grady?" said Erika, voice low and even. "How about you join Sebastian and I for dinner?"

"Oh, I must be on my way," she said. "I wouldn't want to trouble the two of you."

"Of course not, Mrs. Grady," she said. "Sebastian and I have so much to thank you for. Let us treat you to a drink at the last. And tourism season is coming soon. We need to discuss the cabin."

Sebastian interrupted before she could protest again.

"Mrs. Grady, it's been too long. Erika and I have been having the hardest time making it into town lately It will be difficult to say when we'll see each other again.

Sebastian smiled charmingly. Her

Mrs Grady's fondness for overcame her supposed emergency.

"Oh alright, just a moment won't hurt. But I really must be getting back soon."

As she settled herself in and muttered about the washing, Sebastian glanced up at Erika, tacitly requesting an explanation. Erika sat down beside Mrs. Grady without another word.

Erika ordered a drink for Mrs. Grady, a small plate for Sebastian and herself, while Sebastian entertained Mrs. Grady with small talk.

"So how was your little excursion," she asked. "We weren't sure that you would come back to us here in ______."

"I'm surprised you even noticed we were gone. We were only away for a few days," said Sebastian. 

"Oh, well, I stopped by on Wednesday, just to---"

[[ deleted 

"Did someone ask for us?" Erika cut in.

Mrs Grady jumped. Her eyes widened as she struggled to decide whether to affirm or deny it.

"Who were they?" Erika demanded. "Did they identify themselves? How many were there?"

"Erika," Sebastian warned. Mrs. Grady had shoved herself as far back from Erika, cornered in her booth. "We weren't expecting any visitors, Mrs. Grady," he said, placating. "Especially not from her side of the family. In-laws," he said apologetically. "I'm sure your son in law doesn't have that problem. What his name, Matt?


"Mark," said Mrs. Grady, letting Sebastian draw her into a conversation on her daughter. Erika rolled her eyes, and tapped her foot impatiently. Sebastian pretend to listen to news of Mrs. Grady's second

grandchild, trying not to let the matter of the guests break his exterior of calm. If someone had come looking for the it could only be bad news, but bullying Mrs. Grady wasn't the right way to get it.

"We don't have time for this, Sebastian," Erika murmured. She pulled off her gloves ]] 

her gloves and picked up her drink.

"Mrs. Grady, cheers."

"Oh, whatever for?" she said, caught off guard.

"It's my birthday soon," said Sebastian, extemporizing. "My 25th."

"Oh, to be so young. Then, cheers. To a happy 25 years and many more."

Mrs. Grady swung her glass to the center of the table. Erika did the same, deliberately brushing her
hand against Mrs. Grady's. 

Her glass thunked against the table, 
spilling beer down the beer across 
the table top. Grady and 
Sebastian stood quickly to keep it 
from dripping onto them.

"Dear, are you alright?"

Erika stood, ignoring the beer soaking 
into her pants. "Fine," she said, 
wiping the tears from her eyes. "Sebastian, 
we should go. Leave some extra 
for the mess. Mrs. Grady, thank 
you for your time."

Erika quickly left the restaurant. 
Sebastian 
muttered an apologies [[apology]] for their 
sudden departure while fumbling 
through his wallet. He threw the 
money on the table and hurried to 
catch up with Erika.

"What's going on, Erika?"

"They showed her a picture of me, 
but old. From back when I was a

coughing up blood yet.))

child. Only a description of 
you. 
Grady wasn't sure if it was us and told 
them as much."

"If they didn't have any recent 
photos of us then it's not the cult."

"The photo of me seemed around 10 
years old. It's probably the Foundation."

Sebastian didn't ask how they had 
found them. He already knew 
the answer. He lowered his head.

"What do we do?" he asked.

Erika collapsed against the van. 
holding her hand to her temples.

"I don't think I can feel 
them," she said. "But doesn't 
mean they're not nearby. Mrs. Grady 
will be calling them on the [[general store]] 
line now, to let them know we're back. 
I---We don't have long, not at all."

She gripped her knees to keep 
them from shaking. Sebastian wondered 
if she was afraid or if it was his own 
fear that made her uncertain. 
He steeled himself. 

"If we leave now we might lose 
them. Head north, away from 
the hospital."

Erika nodded. "Go ahead and get 
in the car. I'll be right there."

[[ maybe at the hospital they're intercepted by the cult / Sasha, Erika tries to kill Sasha, the foundation interrupts ]]

Sebastian climbed in to the passenger 
side while Erika went back to the 
trunk. 
Moments later she threw something
(( they should have fake names))

in the back seat and sat up front. 

"Sorry we never made it 
back to the cabin," she said, 
starting back down the winding road 
to their village.

"It's okay," said Sebastian. "With 
any luck, they'll never realize it was 
us. Maybe in a few years we can 
come back one day."

Erika didn't seem to share his 
unfounded optimism. Sebastian realized 
because the words sounded hollow, 
even to him.

On the long drive out, Sebastian 
tried to memorize the winding valleys, 
the old trees, the hidden streams 
as they passed. It would be a long time 
before he would be able to see 
them again, if ever. But try as 
he could [[might]], he [[ couldn't seem to ]] focus his 
mind on the scenery. Instead it was 
consumed with worry. The Foundation. 
Erika would go back to being a test 
subject, and likely he would be 
back in a cell. Sebastian internally 
cursed himself---he knew that this 
couldn't have lasted forever. [[ when had he started to hope that it would?]] It 
was all borrowed time from the start.

Maybe if he hadn't gotten sick, they 
had never gone to the hospital, they 
might have had more time. Even if 
Sebastian hadn't made it, at least 
Erika would have had a chance 
to be free for a while longer---
surely that was a preferable outcome 
than [[to]] this.

Erika cleared her throat, but said 
nothing. Sebastian turned his attention 
back outwards, trying to plan for 
the future. But the priority was just 
to get as far away as possible---
beyond that, then what? It was impossible 
to know.

Well, not impossible. There was still 
his dreams of the world tree, 
and Erika its errant child, due to return.

Sebastian felt anxiety clamp down 
on his chest like a vice. There was 
too much, too much uncertainty, 
too much fear.

But it didn't have to be this way. 
All he needed to do was provide 
a little more fuel to the flame 
of godhood---a deva was never 
unsure.

Erika slammed on the brakes. Sebastian 
gasped for breath as the seatbelt 
pushed the air from his lungs. Beside 
him Erika held the steering wheel from 
with one hand, the other clutched 
around her mouth. She looked oddly 
wan. Cold sweat dripped from her 
temples.

"I feel... sick," she said. "I might
throw up," she said. "Is it you?"

"No," said Sebastian. "I'm fine."

Erika swallowed dryly. "Up ahead," she said. "They're 
waiting for us, up by the 
highway."

Sebastian felt  his heart fall. "
Then, what will we do?'

Erika turned the car around. 
"We can't stay here. They're 
coming closer." She pressed a 
fist to her mouth.

"Are you okay?" said Sebastian.

"Yeah," she said. "I don't think it's 
me---it's getting stronger. Let's get out of 
here."

Erika accelerated back down the mountain 
road. Sebastian clung to his seat belt, 
as the forest passed by at dangerous 
speeds. Sebastian spun around to look 
behind him. On a thin twist of road 
above them. Sebastian 
saw the flash 
of reflection of the setting sun against 
a window through the trees. Their 
pursuers.

The town came into view before them. 
Though it 
was hidden behind the next hill, 
he knew that there was only the unpaved 
road to their cabin beyond there. 
After that, nothing but wilderness. 
Maybe Erika could survive there for 
a while on her own, but with him 
around...

"Erika--"he said.

She stopped the car. "Get out of 
the car."

(( Mrs. Grady is interrogating S. 
initially. E. turns it around))

"What?"

"Get out of the car, head back into town. 
Find somewhere to hide 
until everything has calmed down."

"What about you?"

"I'm going to go back and 
(( Maybe this all makes more sense if it takes place at the cabin ))

draw them away. Once they're gone, 
the third house down 
main street leaves their keys in the 
car---take it north, I'll 
try and draw them the other way."

Erika reached over and pushed open 
the door, but Sebastian didn't move.

"We're splitting up?"

Even though he had been about to 
propose the same thing, somehow the 
actual prospect seemed unbearable [[ unthinkable ]]. Was 
he supposed to stay behind while Erika 
drove off into the Foundation's 
waiting arms? Even if she managed to evade 
them, how would they find each other again?

Sebastian felt a strange breathlessness 
fill him, as if he were standing on a 
precipice above the howling winds. How 
would he stop her from ending 
humanity?

Erika shook him back to earth, grabbing 
him by the shoulder.

"I won't---"


"Sebastian!" she said, shouting over 
him. He saw his own fear flicker in 
her eyes, but only for a moment. "Sebastian," 
she said more softly. "I promise you, we will 
see each other again. I swear it on my life."

She pressed something into his hands. 
Her gun.

"The bag in the back seat has 
firestarters, food, the rest of our cash."

"What about you?"

"I'll be fine," she said. "Just grab 
me the rifle. It's in the back."

Sebastian reached around 
to grab the bag and gun. As he did so, 
he heard Erika cough 
out a dry heave, biting down into 
her hand to keep herself from vomiting.

"[[are you sure]]Will really you be okay?"

"If this is who I think 
it is, the blood lust should cut right 
through it. Now go. We don't have much 
time."

Sebastian let her push him from 
the car, standing there lamely as she pushed 
the door shut behind him.

"Be well," he heard her say 
behind the glass before driving off.

"Stay safe," he said, far too late for 
her to hear.

The wind howled loudly along the 
now empty mountain road. Sebastian 
shrunk into his coat, trying to convince 
himself the shivers were only from cold. 
From the bag, he pulled the handgun's last 
magazine and practiced loading and 
unloading it as Erika had taught him. 
He put the gun back in the bag. 

It was a long walk into town. He was 
feeling stronger after his visit to the hospital 
than he had in weeks, but still he doubted 
his ability to make the five mile walk 
up and down the foothills, especially if 
he stayed out of sight off the road. 

But there was nothing else to be done. 
Sebastian began the trek to town. 

---

It took much longer than he thought
[[ deleted ]]

(( But this is the first time in my life that I've wanted (to live) things to the stay the way they are ) ))

---

The sky was beginning to 
darken, stars hidden behind heavy clouds that threatened rains. Sebastian had been walking for hours, much longer than he had expected to. Much longer than he was capable of. 

[[ Maybe he walks the road without arriving anywhere, running from pursuers? ]]

Hours ago there had been gunshots---the rapid rattle of automatic fire, the return of solitary of gunshots. They had echoed loudly, through the valley, throwing explosions of sound against the mountain
sides, but only for a moment. Then 
the forest had fallen to stunning 
silence. Sebastian had run then, 
immediately regretting letting Erika 
go on her own. But little of that 
desperation remained now, overpowered 
by exhaustion. 
But it was enough to force him back to his feet 
after as the breaks 
he needed to catch his breath grew 
more and more frequent. 

Progress was slow and halting, growing 
slower as Sebastian's stamina ran low 
and eventually emptied. Only 
sheer willpower kept him moving 
at a snail's pace. At last he crested 
the final foot hill, only a gentle 
incline until he reached the town...

There, in the fast fading light, 
he saw the wreck of their van, 
half driven off the road.

Sebastian felt his blood run cold 
and his mind go numb. Somehow, 
suddenly, he was at the van, gasping 
for breath, limbs screaming with 
soreness, pushed beyond their limits. But 
Sebastian barely noticed. He slammed 
himself in the car's body. There 
were bullets in the car's body, 
its windows were shattered. Sebastian 
heaved open the door. There was blood, but no body.

Its driver's side door had been flung 
open. A crash through the underbrush left 
a path of broken brambles down 
the sloping side of the road. Forgetting 
the coming night, Sebastian followed 
it, slipping down the litter of dead 
leaves.

In the bed of a dried stream the 
trail came to an end. Against the 
bark of a nearby tree there was a smear 
of dark blood. On the ground, the 
rifle and the smell of vomit. 
The leaf litter was thrown violently, 
disturbed by a crowd of people. 
But there was no body.

Sebastian, breathing heavily, collapsed, 
hands on his knees. 
She hadn't managed 
to escape. They had taken her. But 
she was still alive. She had 
promised him they would see each other again.

Sebastian felt the future stretch 
out before him * [[ his head spun as the future stretched out before him ]] Years would pass, 
but whether he spent them searching for her, or waiting in the shade of their old home, he could not say. 
Maybe she would escape, maybe he 
would rescue her, but in the end they 
would see each other again. She had 
promised.

*He would reach town, steal a car, abandon it 
in the next city over, and take a bus 
into the distance disappear. They would 
bring her to their facilities, run 
their experiments, lock her away. 
But it all started with him reaching town 
and from there onto the rest of their lives. 
Sebastian traced his path back to the 
road and then onwards to the town.

As Sebastian resumed the 
trek along the mountain road, the wind 
began to howl, driving the beginnings 
of rain into Sebastian's face. There 
was barely enough light to follow the 
road by, Sebastian fished the flashlight 
(torch?) from the backpack 
and followed its small circle of light 
into the dark.

In the dark, it was difficult to 
gauge his progress. As he sat down in the 
beneath the boughs of 
an evergreen tree to rest his legs, he 
consulted the map, trying to correlate the 
twists and turns of his memory with the map. 
He was moving slowly, but surely by now 
he should have reached the town.

A heavy raindrop rolled from his chin splattered against the 
center of the map. Sebastian reflexively 
brushed it away, but it left a long 
red streak against the text of the map. 
Sebastian quickly dried and folded away the 
map before tracing a hand up the side of 
his face. His fingertips quickly found 
the tear in his skin, wrapping 
along the base of his jaw. Though his 
hands came away wet [[dark]] with blood, 
Sebastian could barely feel it, face 
wet and numb by the strike of cold rain. 
Clumsily, he did his best to tape a bundle 
of gauze to try and staunch the bleeding, but 
in the rain the tape would not stick. He would 
have to make due, 
a holding a hand to his chin. Sebastian 
continued down the road. 

Erika had mentioned, when they 
had been preparing their emergency bags, 
that a mirror would probably come in 
useful, considering the number of times 
Sebastian had asked her to read a 
new prophecy to him. Sebastian had 
laughed it off and asked her if she was 
calling him vain. Now Sebastian regretted 
not taking her advice. Though the
prophecies were confusing 
at worst and cryptic at best, in these 
uncertainty times [[uncertain]] even a glimmer of knowledge seemed 
precious...

Keeping beneath the trees to 
avoid the worst of the rain, and 
stepping through the beginnings of the 
streams of floodwater, Sebastian came 
at last to the crest of the hill. From 
here he should be able to see the town.

Sebastian stopped dead in his tracks. 
Before him, dark and flat, was the lake 
by their cabin. Even in the dark there 
was no disputing it. Sebastian spun 
around, confused. When [[he]] had gone off [[left]]
the road, he hadn't managed to go 
the wrong way, had he? No, it was 
impossible. Even if he had managed 
to lose his sense of direction, their 
car had been headed towards the town. 
There was no way he had gotten 
turned around. 
Sebastian ran his finger along his chin. 
The gauze he had been trying to stop 
the bleeding had long since soaked 
through by the spray of rain. At this 
point Sebastian only kept it pressed 
to his skin in the vain hope that it would 
keep the blood from running into 
his clothes. Now he pulled it away, trying 
carefully to trace out that message there. 
His fingers were almost too numb 
to feel out the words. But there was 
one word, he could make out: HOME.

In the distance, he could actually 
make out the cabin's lights, 
much brighter than he would have thought. 
As far as he knew, 
they had not left the power on when they 
had fled. Likely someone had come by 
since they had left, likely they were 
still there. But Sebastian was exhausted, 
cold and wet, and now losing blood. 
And he had a sinking suspicion that turning 
around to go back to town would be as 
fruitless as his first attempt.

[[ There is no escaping, until you agree to go to her ]] 

So Sebastian continued down the hill
back towards their home.

---

[[ Erika influences him to leave, he realizes what a terrible mistake it was once she's gone ]]

Spot lights flooded their tiny home, 
powered by the engine of the black 
trucks Sebastian had seem glimpses of 
on the mountains. 
The armed men and women milled around, 
waiting and killing time.

Sebastian stumbled down the road, 
immediately attracting their attention. 
But there was no other reaction than 
to report his presence on their radios. 
No one stopped him as he staggered 
to the cabin's front door. 

Before he could reach it, the door 
opened. Out stepped a man and a woman [[switch order]], 
both wearing white lab coats and 
gloves. Behind them, Sebastian could see 
their home in disarray, torn apart, 
various articles removed, others trapped 
in specimen bags.

"We weren't expecting you for a few 
more hours," said the woman. 
"Though 
perhaps it's better this way. If you had 
tried for town again we might have 
had to comb the mountain for your 
body."

"Who are you?" asked Sebastian, swaying 
dangerously.

"How rude of me. 
My name is Dr. Mallory Weaver. 
This is my assistant, Gillian Cook. 
We work for the Foundation."

There was something strangely familiar 
about her. Sebastian 
recognized neither her face nor her voice, 
but something about her mannerisms and 
aspect was intensely familiar.

"No need to introduce yourself," 
she said, tapping 
her chin, mirrored from Sebastian's 
newest wound. "According 
to Dr. Bedlam's notes you are the 
Augur. And while it might have saved 
you some time, unfortunately it 
won't you from the Spiral itself.
Gillian, you can deactivate it now."

The man returned into the 
cabin. Moments later, imperceptibly 
something about the environment changed 
imperceptibly, but noticeably ((think 
of something better)) There was a 
universal sigh of relief from the armed 
men behind them, and they began 
to pack their things in their vehicles, preparing 
to leave. 

"Will you come willingly with us? 
You're in no position to resist. But 
that never stops your kind. Even our 
little Empath 
thought she could get away. But she's just 
as susceptible to emetics as she was 
as a child, even if we had to apply it 
a little unconventionally this time," she 
said to her assistant. She held her 
fist to her mouth to illustrate.

Suddenly Sebastian realized 
the source of the misplaced familiarity. 
Though they looked 
nothing alike, her posture and mannerisms 
were just like Erika's. Or rather, Erika's 
were borrowed from hers.

"Where is she?" Sebastian asked quietly.

"Already on her way back to facility 83. 
Does that influence your decision?" 
she smiled cruelly. "What 
do you think, Gillian? Did our empath 
find a lover in her long trip 
away from home?"

"Our notes say she is not capable," 
Gillian responded.

"It's been oh, is it 8 years 
now, since she was last 
in our care. We have a lot to catch up 
on."

Sebastian, through the haze of exhaustion, 
was filled with revulsion towards this woman, 
even though her words slid past him, 
too tired to understand. 

One of 
the armed men came over to notify her that 
they were ready to leave. She nodded 
and wrapped up her conversation with her 
assistant. She looked over to Sebastian 
disdainfully. 

"Just take him with us," she said, seeing 
that he was too dazed to respond. "You 
probably won't even need to sedate him." 

---

(( Probably some sort of dream scene))
The dark stone of the gate formed
a path beneath his feet. In the 
shifting mists it was the only thing 
of any substance. 
Though he knew that 
beyond the 
wall of fog was a vast land, other 
paths to wander, all else was swallowed 
by the haze. Even his conception 
of self seemed fluid and indistinct.

Sebastian thought of his 
childhood. Though there was little he 
could remember from 
the time when he lived with his parents, back then 
there had been many paths to wander, 
large clearings within the 
fog, that to a child, seemed vast 
and unsizeable. But it had not lasted 
long. He had only been four 
when they had been struck by a car, and 
the walls of fog had closed in then, 
leaving only a meandering path through 
the mists then, as he found himself 
in a new life with his aunt and uncle.

Since then, 
each day had brought a little more 
clarity, a little more space between 
the labyrinth of mists. Soon though the 
tragedy of his childhood had more 
or less faded away, only rearing 
its ugly head with the occasional 
jealousy of his cousins and the favors 
that their parents bestowed on them. 
Back then, in adolescence, it 
had seemed like the greatest injustice 
in the world, but now with wiser 
eyes he saw how it had widened his 
path, driven him to achieve 
for his own approval when his parents 
could not grant their own.

And then, the onset, of the illness
or the curse. 
In waking, Sebastian could barely stand to 
think of all the mistakes he had made 
back then, but dreaming, he 
was free of the embarrassment 
and regret. They were choices born of deep 
denial, of anger, of despair. Each 
one enclosed him further 
into a single winding path. For 
years he had agonized and blamed 
himself for trapping himself into 
hospital beds and prison cells, where 
the walls of mist were so near he lost 
sight of anything tangible, incapable 
of seeing anything in the future. 
But now, he knew that 
denial, anger, despair---they 
were unavoidable, a part 
of life as a human, and that 
the mistakes that 
he had made had only hastened 
slightly the inevitable. 

Because now the way had grown so 
thin that the mists pressed in on both
sides, blinding him as he walked the 
narrow trail.*The nature of the curse was 
that it would steal from him slowly 
his friends, his health, his family 
so that his path would narrow  [[ but why does Erika stick around? ]]
until it came to an end. He would walk 
the path that fate intended him and 
then die when his purpose was fulfilled. 

But there were other paths, out there, 
in the mists. All the time, it seemed, 
he would cross them, but could not follow. 
To do so would be to lose himself 
to the fog. And somehow, he knew 
the cost would be his very self, that 
fragile thing trapped within the mists. 

[[each pass near their entwining 
vapors sent a chill, a horrible deadness 
down through his skin, into his bones]]

---

(( Next scene is Erika in the lab, but first some more fluff in the middle of the night ))

Erika woke up in the middle of the night. 
night was quiet, with the hushed quality 
that brought on only by the falling snow. 
Sebastian was awake as well, morose, 
drunk.

He sat 
by the window sill, letting the cold 
of the glass and the winter beyond 
seep through his clothes and onto 
his back. He had worked his way 
through two of their leftover beers, 
and was onto his third.

"Bad dreams?" she asked, walking 
over to sit by him.

"Yeah," he said. "You know, you've 
asked that question before."

"I have?"

"When we first met. The night they 
took me from Bedlam."

"I remember now," 
she said. "Your 
dreams were keeping me awake. It's 
hard to fall asleep when next to you someone's 
convinced they're going to die."

"Do you still have trouble sleeping?" Sebastian 
asked.

"Not as much anymore," she said. 
"Why do you ask?"

"Oh, well, I still have those dreams. 
The same ones every time."

They sat in silence for a while 
watching the snow fall onto the 
frozen lake. Sebastian's mind wandered, 
slowly dwelling here and there, trying 
to find a way to bring up what was on his mind. Every 
time, she felt him consider whether 
to mention them to her, each time 
he decided against it. Instead he 
took another drink from his bottle 
and offered Erika the rest.

"I had sworn off alcohol, believe 
it or not. Stayed 
sober for four years, too. Though 
that's not really much of an accomplishment 
when most of those were spent at a 
mental ward and then a clean-living 
commune."

"What happened?" she asked. [[ automatically, finding immediately the topic he meant to dance around.]]

"It was only about a few months after 
the Augur stuff started happening.
My aunt and 
uncle were didn't want 
to let me go back to my second year 
of uni, but I demanded. Pulled out 
all the stops---accused them of loving 
me less than their own children, doing 
wrong by my dead parents. I broke 
their hearts, but I went back to 
school in the fall.

"And then a few weeks into the term, 
the second prophecy showed up. 
Didn't tell the 
about it. And then a month later, right 
before an important exam, the third. I bombed it. 
Couldn't stop thinking 
started to realize that this wasn't going 
to be a one off thing. The rest of my life--- 
That, and my parents---my aunt + uncle---had called 
me the day before, full of concern, 
asking me if I was alright, letting me 
know that I could always come home---
I got pissed. I tried not to let it get 
to me, but then my mates took me out I got drunk and 
I self-destructed. Made 
out with another girl at the pub in 
front of my girlfriend, blew off all my 
friends. Next morning 
I woke up at that woman's flat, still drunk as shit. I don't even remember her name---she was screaming at me---I'd bled all over the place, she thought I was dead, she'd called an ambulance. My phone was blowing up, my girlfriend calling me, my friends telling me I was trash for hurting her like this. If I was thinking my life was ruined, I made sure of it that night. Well, to be honest, [[if I were being honest with myself]] things were still salvageable then. But it didn't seem that way to me."

"And then I really fucked up. I tried to kill myself. Downed a bottle of ____ from her medicine cabinet. Didn't work, of course, I forgot that she'd called an ambulance even before I tried. They got the pills out of me before they'd even kicked in. Didn't matter, though. Now no 
one would believe me when I tried to 
say I didn't cut myself. Even when 
they started showing up where I couldn't 
reach, even under constant monitoring. 
My aunt + uncle would tell me they believed 
me when I said it wasn't me, but since 
that day, I don't know they ever saw me as 
anything but damaged goods." [[ ever saw me the same since.]]

"Still, seems like overkill 
to send you to a psychiatric 
hospital for the next four years 
of your life."

"It was only 3. And I was the one 
who convinced them to do it. After two 
years of seeing dermatologists, phlebotomists,
 and oh-so many shrinks, I was done. My 
cousin, their oldest daughter had 
come down with Chrons 
on top of everything as well. So I talked 
it up, Bedlham. Said that I could continue 
my studies through them, told them how 
much I loved the city + the mountain, 
lied about their revolutionary community 
integration programs. They said goodbye 
with a smile on their faces----they 
were happy for me. And I was happy 
for them. They'd finally gotten rid of 
that ungrateful son they'd never even wanted."

Erika didn't bother pointing out that they 
would likely never have thought that. Sebastian 
knew that it was his own 
self disgust that brought that line of 
thinking. It reared its ugly head every 
time they went to the town's 
general store and passed they [[the]] pay phone 
which they had never used.

"Regretted it immediately of course. The 
second they were gone. All that fog of self-hate 
lifted and I realized what I'd done. It was hell there, in Bedlam. 
People screaming every night. They 
treated us like animals. I started to go
mad as well---though I would come out 
of it every once and a while to 
berate myself for getting myself into this. 
For the longest time I wanted nothing more 
than for things to back to the way 
things were. Still do, on some level. But 
I'm starting to accept that that's not possible 
any more."

Sebastian shivered against the window 
pane, and finished up his drink. 
He didn't seem particularly to enjoy 
it. 

"I didn't really feel like telling 
you about all of this," said Sebastian, 
leaning his forehead against the glass. "But 
here I am, making bad decisions again."

[[ I can hardly blame you for a night of bad decisions when I've been making them my whole life. / How do you deal with it? / Realize that nobody really manages to do any better. ]]

"Why not? You thought I'd think less of you?"

"More or less. You seem to be under the 
impression that I'm a good person. [[ I get the feeling you look up to me. ]] But 
just like everybody else, I do 
the same stupid shit to myself 
and complain about it like it wasn't my fault."

"There's no such thing as a good person," 
Erika said. 
"If there were 
that would mean there are evil people 
as well. I'd probably be one of them. But 
listening to people's feelings and thoughts, 
you learn that there's 
no such thing as good or evil. We all just 
make stupid decisions out of 
fear, or selfishness, or guilt, or hormones. 
To be honest, that pretty much sums 
up the whole of the human 
condition." 


"You're such a cynic."

Erika shrugged. "If you 
say so. But it's not so bad. 
I'm fucked up, but so is everybody else. 
Knowing 
makes it easier to relate to them."

"Empathize, maybe even?" Sebastian 
asked, raising an eyebrow. 

"Maybe," she said, scowling. But 
only for a moment.

Sebastian settled back into the 
bed, pulling the blankets over his 
shoulders. The moonlight reflecting 
off the snow cast a dim blue light 
through their cabin, making all surfaces 
seem ghostly and soft, 
save where 
shadows pooled. 
Sebastian's silhouette was mottled with them. 
Beneath his brow, in the folds of his 
blankets, even in the rough skin of his 
scars. But what was 
free of them seemed 
to glow with its own light. 


"It's nice, the snow."

Sebastian nodded. "Beautiful," he said, 
but with some sadness.

He leaned towards her. 
Sober he could fight the human 
instinct for closeness, but drunk it seemed 
too much a bother. Erika shifted 
to keep the blankets between them, but 
didn't push him away. (( E. gets confused when people get too close. ))

He was thinking about the impermanence 
of this moment. That the snowfall would 
end. Dawn would come. The 
lake would melt. The more beautiful 
the moment, the more difficult to 
let it go. It 
was the same for their time together 
at the lakeside. Sooner or later, 
it would come to end, and then 
what would there be left to 
remember it by, when they were gone?

Erika stood suddenly, letting Sebastian 
struggle to catch himself. 

"What's wrong?" he asked. 

She stepped back, backing away 
from him. "Sorry, I just need to 
clear my head. I---"

Her heart was racing. Was it 
fear? But 
Sebastian 
was calm, still morose, a little confused. 
Her own, then? What was she afraid 
of? 

Of losing this. Of losing him. The 
thought that life was short, subject 
to chance and forces beyond their 
control. All this she had known before, but 
it hadn't mattered then. If she had died 
in her sleep, she might have considered 
it a blessing, but now...

"I---I never," she stammered, but 
couldn't find the words to say. 

"Sometimes I wish I were an empath,"
said Sebastian, "
Maybe then I could tell what you're thinking. 
But I guess that's part of your mysterious 
allure."

Erika felt her heart throb painfully, but 
she pushed it aside. "Go back to sleep, 
Sebastian."

"I think I"ll stay up a little longer. See 
how long the snow falls."

"Well, I'm going to sleep then," she grumbled, 
retreating back to the couch. She wondered 
how Sebastian could manage it, carrying 
happiness and fear together, one in 
each hand. She took these 
troubled thoughts with her to the couch, 
letting them mingle with Sebastian's 
quiet reflection until they let her 
fall into sleep. 

---

"'One day these too shall 
pass', used to be a comfort 
to me. Now it scares me 
as it never has before."

"I'm so scared and confused
I used to push everything 
away but I can't do that 
anymore. I feel 
so many things---I can't make 
them stop. I wish I could 
make things go back to 
the way they were---I 
wish I could feel nothing at all."

---

The moment [[ As soon as they]] they 
removed the restraints, Erika fought 
to free herself. In vain, though. The 
next moment, she found herself locked 
to the steel table, unable to move hand 
or foot.

The door opened. In stepped Dr. Weaver 
followed closely by Gillian. Erika stiffened 
and looked away. [[ cross marker]]

"I thought our reunion might be a 
little more touching," she said. Pulling a chair 
up to the laboratory bench. 
Sitting brought them almost 
face to face, but not quite. 

"Are you surprised to see me? Much has 
changed since we lost track of you. 
Dr. Philips is gone. [[Naturally, his position has ]] passed on to me," 
she gloated.

"You know if the old goat were still around, he might have been pleased to see you all grown up now. Might have even been proud you've learned, at least outwardly, how to behave like a normal human being. * But Dr. Philips is dead. And his belief that he could understand anomalies like you is the reason why. I won't make the same mistake." **

* Weaver leaned in close, inspecting her carefully with unfeeling eyes. Erika stared straight ahead.

** The words were spoken with such venom, Erika couldn't help but flinch. But despite Weaver's undisguised



hatred towards her, she was not afraid---and instead reflect the malice back at her. 

[[ Cross marker]] "Looks like subject still has the same physiological reaction to contact," Weaver dictated to Gillian. She stepped toward the lab bench, wiping away the tears from Erika's eyes [[ with a gloved hand ]]. "No sign of any associated mental distress. The other labs envy us, you know? If only other subjects were both so interesting yet so easy control. 

"Looks like we can pick up right where we left off, Gillian," she said, turning sharply away from Erika. "There is of course some discontinuity due to her age, but it seemed that not much has changed with regards to her temperament since she was a child.

"You left us at a very inconvenient time, you know," she chided. 

"Back then we knew so little about the 
human brain that hypothesize [[ing]] 
about what was going on in yours was 
shooting in the dark she explained to Erika. Since then 
human neuroscience has progressed 
by leaps and bounds. No 
more messing about with emetics and 
salivary gland responses. We can measure 
neural responses directly."

"Though," she said, massaging a set 
of electrodes into Erika's hair. "That's 
not quite true. We'll need to calibrate the old vomit responses 
against the new neural ones. One 
last dose of emetic."

(( need more description of the 
lab and Weaver needs to talk more 
to Gillian + less to Erika))

---


(( Have all of Erika's scenes 
come first. Got to meld these two 
together properly ))

"Are you unsettled, Gillian?" 
Dr. Weaver asked from the computer. 
Across the room, Gillian had been tasked 
with preparing 
their subject for electroencephalography. 
As he applied electrodes to her 
scalp, she stared stone faced, 
not even 
flinching as he took a razor to 
her hair [[scalp]] for better contact. The 
only sign she was still awake and 
aware was her eyes, following 
him around the room.

"Because she is trying to unsettle you," 
Weaver said. 

"It's...not what I expected," Gillian 
admitted.

"One would expect 
Empath to name a more emotional 
creature, wouldn't you?" 
said Weaver. 
"Especially 
first day back in the lab after such 
a fleeting taste of [[sweet]] freedom. But 
that's not to say she is incapable 
of emotion. In fact, as a child 
she scored extremely high in 
our tests for emotional intensity. But 
hiding such responses from us 
gives her a feeling of control over 
the situation."

Weaver stood up sharply. She 
stood at the foot of the lab bench, 
where Erika could see her only if she
craned her neck upward. 

Gillian returned to attempting to 
check the contact of the electrodes 
on Erika's head. As he approached 
the table, Erika's eyes spun sharply 
to face him, with such withering 
hate that he couldn't help but flinch. 
Weaver rolled her eyes.

"Hurry up, Gillian. There are only 
so many hours in the day." [[ should have mannerism Erika and Weaver share ]]

A particularly troubling contact 
positioned at the base of her skull 
needed readjusting. As Gillian undid 
the strap around her head to attend 
to it, Erika [[used her head to ]] slammed his 
hand against the bench, shaking the rest free. 
Gillian quickly withdrew his hand, 
shaking away the soreness. 

[[ I thought you would have outgrown this pointless defiance ]]

"Enough of this pointless defiance," 
Weaver growled, standing sharply. 
"You may be entertaining 
the thought of escaping once again, 
but I'll remind you that you never would 
have managed it without that damned 
nurse's help. And you're no longer so 
childish and innocent [[ can no longer fake being ... ]] you can beguile some 
simpleton into assisting you. You are 
going to spent the rest of your life 
as a ward of this lab---
so it's in your best interests 
to make both our lives as easy as 
possible."

[[ "...So are you." "What?" "I said, 'So are you. You'll spend the rest of your life no freer than I..."]]

Gillian fidgeted nervously, 
unused to Dr. Weaver's temper, usually 
only a tool wielded in dire circumstances. 
He had never seen her so quick to anger 
before. 

Their subject didn't seem cowed. She 
narrowed her eyes.

"You're 48 years old now," she 
said. "Without an worthy 
accomplishment to your name. You thought 
Dr. Phillips was standing in your way, but 
now that he's gone you've only got yourself 
to blame. [[ You know that it was your own fault all along. ]]"

Weaver narrowed her eyes. "Shut her up, 
Gillian."

(( How can I hold on night of bad decisions against you when I've been making them all my life? ))

"And just when you thought you were free 
of this damned project, I come back 
and everyone remembers that you've been 
contaminated, [[you contaminated me]]---"

Gillian pulled the gag between her 
teeth. Erika bared her teeth around 
the strap like a demented smile.

"That was on Phillip's orders," 
Weaver spat. "
And I was not contaminated. 
It was the 
maternal [[ need some better word ]] experiment---my predecessor's 
reckless hypothesis, to have 
sustained contact with her," she explained to Gillian. "Despite
my seniority in the lab he picked me, as the 
only woman in the lab. 3 months toting 
a dumb and mute child around. An 
annoyance but no lasting affects, not for 
me. But our little child empath wasn't 
quite the same. Her reception of my 
emotions is approximately 200x stronger than 
on average. She probably hasn't even noticed 
that her freakish friend is in the next 
room over."

It was the first time she had 
shown any expression other than disinterest 
or open hostility. Weaver seemed to 
relish in her unabashed shock. 

"That's right---your selfless sacrifice 
into our waiting arms was 
all for naught. 
We had the two 
of you well and truly trapped in our non-
euclidean spacetime---but it was still 
amusing to see you try and break free, 
truly heartbreaking your tearful goodbye."

Weaver stepped up to the table, 
looking down disdainfully.  
Suddenly Erika 
began to struggle against her restraints. 

"Have you noticed at last? He's 
undergoing the same initial procedure [[intake]] 
as you. Part of the process is 
inspection for foreign bodies in those 
wounds of his. Can you feel 
them tear into the newly healed wounds in 
your skin as they tear into 
his? Can  you feel his pain? Do you feel alone and scared? 
Maybe you can, just a bit. But 
rather you feel my utter interference, 
even my sadistic delight at seeing freaks like 
you suffer---"

Dr. Weaver's hand was on the restraint 
on Erika's shoulder, just above where 
she had been shot. She pressed 
down hard, forcing it into the fresh wound.

"Dr. Weaver!"

Gillian grabbed at her arm. For 
a moment, she seemed taken aback 
that he had dared to touch her, but 
she came to her senses. [[ for a moment it seemed her anger would turn towards him, for daring to touch her]]

"Let go of me," she said stiffly. "
Now get those electrodes applied [[reword]]. 
We only have so many hours in the day. [[bleh, repeat]]
and a decade's worth of experiment to 
run."

---

"Sincerely, we apologize for your 
treatment earlier. 
But to be fair, we couldn't 
have foreseen that none of the anesthetic 
would work. Your physiology is otherwise 
normal."

"I've been through worse," said Sebastian warily. 

The room they held him [[in]] was surprisingly 
well furnished. In addition to the normal 
fixtures of a cell that Sebastian had come to 
expect, there was a table and a 
chair, a lamp, a sofa chair. 
There was a bookshelf, but whoever 
had thought of the gesture hadn't put much 
effort into filling it with books. 

But despite its niceties, it was still 
a cell. between him and his guest was 
a wall of thick bullet proof glass. Sound 
was transmitted between the two of them 
by means of microphones and speakers hidden 
within the walls. [[speakers distorted the words between them with plasticky static ]] The room's only egress 
was a doors set heavy in a steel, locked from 
inside and out with thick bolts. 

Hours ago, Sebastian had come to, groggy 
with sedation. As soon as the effects 
of the drugs had worn off, he was 
put through the most thorough medical 
examination of his life, conducted by 
doctors in hazmat suits. Though, as soon 
as he was cleared of any toxic or 
radioactive substances, they were removed 
and the examination proceeded more or less 
normally. 

Well, except for when they 
insisted on searching the wounds on his 
chest for signs of foreign bodies ((Since 
the latest one was on his face 
they elected the reopen the ones on his 
chest to avoid excessive scarring )). As 
it had at the cult, their local anesthetic 
failed to dampen the pain, even though 
it made the skin numb to the touch. 

Despite feeling 
like someone had fed him only partially 
through a meat grinder, Sebastian 
felt almost reassured about the 
purposeful examination. It had been a 
long time since his wounds had received any 
medical attention. Especially without 
a trace of skepticism and less 
than subtle hints that he might be 
ill. insane. 

Not quite, though. He stood with 
his arms crossed at the center of the 
room, deliberately refusing to make 
himself comfortable in what was 
ostensibly his new home. The man in 
front of him was in 
his mid 50s, stern, gray haired. He had 
introduced himself as Dr. Graham 
Alto, director of the Foundation's 
division of Foresight. [[precognition?]]

"The examination was part of our 
onboarding [[intake]] procedure," he 
said. "Necessary for your safety and ours."

"Perhaps. But 
there will be more, won't they [[there]]? 
Those words sound 
particularly empty once you string 
me up like a lab rat," said Sebastian.

"There will be additional studies, 
yes," said Alto. "But learning more 
about your infliction is 
again for both our benefit[[s]]. One 
day we may even discover a way 
to cure you."

"Don't lie to me, 
Director of Foresight," said Sebastian, 
hating the way his heart still jumped at 
hope [[bleh ]] even at the suggestion of 
a cure, even after all these years. "I've 
heard that one before---I lived in a 
cage for three years waiting for a cure 
[[being reassured they would cure me. And I'm still like this now.]]"

[[I've seen what hope can do]]

"You seem to have some poor past 
experiences," said Dr. Alto. "Rest assured 
that at Foundation, containment 
is our number one priority. [[ The foundation's first priority is containment ]]. 
We have no desire to amass 
collections of the paranormal, no delusions 
of supernatural grandeur. Both 
of us would prefer that the supernatural 
have as minimal effect on our lives 
as possible."


"Then why am I still alive?" Sebastian 
asked. "Isn't it simpler to kill me?"

Dr. Alto shook his head. "Some very 
bad experiences. It is against our policies 
to...euthanize humanoid anomalies. 
Even in situations where this inconveniences 
to us. Besides we prefer your cooperation."

Sebastian was skeptical. "What for?"

"If there's any resource the Foundation 
most desperately lacks, it is knowledge," 
said Dr. Alto. He began to pace. "The 
department of foresight is 
an attempt to remedy this critical flaw [[shortage]]. 
Even if it requires relying on what 
we're required to contain. From 
Dr. Bedlam's notes, you have an 
impressive accuracy, and not to 
mention unlike 
your average soothsayer you're still sane. 
Frankly this is a rare opportunity 
for us. Will you accept? As a minimum 
security anomaly we'd even consider 
transferring you to England, 
though we'd only be able to allow you 
limited access outside, due to your 
unusual appearance, and the need for 
regular medical attention. Will you augur for us?"

Sebastian was silent. He kept 
his eyes to the ground. 

"I'll think about it," he said, at 
last. 

"I'll check back [[I'll be back]] tomorrow for your 
answer. Please consider it carefully 
until then."

Dr. Alto bowed out to excuse himself. 
As he turned to leave, Sebastian called 
out to him. 

"Wait, Dr. Alto."

"Yes?"

"When you brought me here---with me, 
there was another."

"You mean H-473, the Empath?"

"Is...she okay?"

"She's here, in this facility," he 
said. "At least for now. 
They are due to move soon." [[back to their old facility]]

"Could I see her?" Sebastian said, 
trying to keep the quaver
from his voice.

"We general[[ly]] try to avoid letting 
anomalies mingle to avoid adverse reactions. 
But depending on your answer, I can 
see what can be arranged."

"I understand," said Sebastian, 
curling his hands into fists. 

---

"Administer the next dose," Dr. Weaver 
dictated over the intercom.

At one end of the room, one of the lab's 
assistants injected a dose of drugs into 
the arm of one of their test subjects. 
Almost immediately, the man began to 
vomit violently into the bucket at 
his feet. At the other end, Erika, 
mouth propped open the accommodate the 
sensors pressed against 
the salivary gland, began to retch. 
Though they kept a bucket at her feet [[as well]] 
it was empty. After hours of testing, there 
was nothing left in her stomach to throw 
up. 

For these tests, they allowed her sit up, 
lest she choke on her own vomit. But 
her arms and legs were still bound to the 
chair. Her eyes were blindfolded and 
her ears covered by heavy headphones. 

At the other end of the room, the 
man who had just vomited was lead 
away to cleanup and change his clothes. 
Another came to take his place, this 
time [[seated]] slightly further away. 

"The results are strange," Gillian 
said to Dr. Weaver as she watched the 
experiments proceed. "Even after removing 
the possibility of a sympathetic reaction 
to the sight or sound of vomiting, 
our results are still 
inconsistent with the data from when 
she was younger. The maximum distance 
for a recorded response is a little longer 
but only at a neural level. The salivary 
response falls of sharply at a distance of 
only 20m, less than a third of her range 
as a child."

"Hm," Weaver hummed, watching Erika 
slumped over in the chair. "Anecdotally 
we've even seen her respond to people's 
emotional reactions at a much greater 
distance than that. 
As she grew we saw 
a steady increase in the distance of 
effect, though that began to level out 
with pubescence. It seems unlikely 
that her powers have 
decreased since then." 
Weaver sighed into her palm. "But 
then why the decreased salivary response. 
It should be an entirely autonomic 
reaction---she should have no control. Especially 
since we're seeing the corresponding 
increase in activity in the hypothalamus."

Weaver paused to watch the experiment 
proceed. Erika [[ the Empath? ]] hacked a cough around 
the apparatus fixed to her mouth. She wrinkled 
her nose. "It stinks in here."

"I'll instruct the staff to run the fans," 
said Gillian.

"Have them clean up the whole thing," 
said Dr. Weaver with disinterest. "It's 
getting late. Let's do the contact test 
and then call an end 
to the day."

As Gillian oversaw the cleanup

of the test, while Weaver wandered over to 
Erika. 

For a moment she stared at her, hunched 
limp over the bucket. Even though she knew Erika 
could not see nor hear her, she raised her 
head to look up at her. Weaver felt a wave 
of revulsion rise up in her. What had left 
as an uncooperative and waif-like 
child had returned as an even more uncooperative 
and [[ugly]] adult. Somehow she derived some twisted 
satisfaction at seeing an awkward and 
ugly child not swanned into some beautiful 
woman [[not some beautiful youth]]. Rather her numerous scars, 
heavy muscles, rough aspect [[well knotted scars across her wrists]] 
were indicative that life on the 
outside wasn't any easier than locked 
in the lab. 

Weaver imagined that the Empath saw her in 
a similar light--the old tormentor of her 
youth, gray haired, cynical, 
career locked into the Foundation's 
narrow path of slow advancement and little 
prestige. Within the month they would be 
moving to a remote facility to carry out their 
experiments with minimal interference. 
It was unclear whether the progress 
they would make in their research 
would cover the costs of being moved even 
further out of sight and out of 
mind. She wondered if she felt the same sick pleasure.

"But you'll never see him again, either," 
she whispered ((dunno that I like this line)) [[indulging in her sick pleasure of seeing her flinch.]]

The lab staff came to remove the 
device from her mouth. As they 
pulled it free she coughed 
violently, shuddering as spit pooled 
and flowed from her mouth. 
They removed the blindfold and headphones. 
Beneath the cloth, her eyes were red 
and swollen. Through the tears, she glared 
up at Weaver. 

"Is the fMRI prepared, Gillian?"

"They'll be ready in a moment."

"Good," she said. "Get the subject 
on a gurney and let them know 
we'll be there momentarily."

It had been a long day. She and the lab 
had initially been excited to resume their 
old work, but the exhaustion of dealing 
with an unruly subject had set in more 
quickly than Weaver would have expected. 
They'd dealt with madmen and vegetables on 
the regular, but they were little more than 
animals. No, the difficulty was that in 
the end, 
when she looked at her, Weaver 
saw too much of herself. 
No matter how she had tried to 
drive the distance between them, that damned 
experiment had drawn 
them too close...

As the technicians prepared her for the 
machine, she felt Gillian watching 
her from across the room. Perhaps he too 
noticed the similarity between her and her subject. 
Weaver gritted her teeth. 

She is not my child.

"What is the delay?" Weaver demanded
stalking over to the machine. 

Erika lay on the gurney, looking small half 
swallowed by the behemoth of the 
machine. Again her arms and legs were 
restrained, but they had not replaced the gag. 
Nonetheless, she wasn't speaking, perhaps 
to avoid being gagged again. Gillian 
signaled the 
technicians waiting in the room beyond 
to see the delay. 

"They say the machine is ready," 
said Gillian. "But the personnel we've 
requested for the contact test 
was hospitalized earlier today due to an issue with 
H-711. They're estimating a 
three hour wait for a replacement to 
be arranged. 

"This is unacceptable," Weaver growled. 
"Once we move, it will be months 
until we have access to the proper machinery. 
We don't have time for this. I will 
perform the contact test."

"Dr. Weaver, are you sure that---"

"If there were no adverse affects after 
three months of sustained contacted, 30 seconds 
won't kill me," she said. "Tell the technicians 
to ready the machine."

[[ Erika should struggle when she hears this. ]]

From the mouth of the machine Erika 
glared at her hatefully. Weaver couldn't 
help but mirror the expression as the 
machine spun up, whirring loudly. 
From the machine's monitors 
Gillian gave her the okay to proceed. Weaver 
reached out to 
touch the exposed skin of her leg---

[[ maybe they try with normal personnel and then nothing happens, so Weaver has to try it herself ]]

The thudding sound of the 
machine winding down echoed loudly 
in her ears with the pulse of her blood. 
Breathe---she couldn't breath. The 
cause was obvious---Gillian, face red 
and twisted, had his hands around her 
throat. 

Weaver struggled to pry his hands from 
around her neck. As her vision began to darken, 
[[she]] used the last 
vestiges of her strength to raise her hand 
to his face. She slapped him as hard as 
she could manage. 

By some miracle, it seemed to restore 
him to his senses. He dropped her, where she 
collapsed, gasping for breath. 

"Dr. Weaver---Oh my god, I--- 
Did I---I don't know what 
came over me---"

As she caught her breath, she tried to 
peace [[piece]] together the last few moments. She 
had been about to start the contact test, 
she had reached out to make contact, and 
then---nothing. The next moment 
Gillian was throttling 
her against the wall...

"It was her," she gasped. 
Gillian looked over to the machine where 
the subject was still strapped to the table. 
His expression was of growing horror. [[Erika should probably still be gagged ]]

"The Empath," he breathed. 

"How could I not have noticed?" Weaver 
hissed. It was so obvious now. All 
day, Gillian's skittishness, the staff's 
inefficiency---but she had been the most 
affected. The constant 
irritation, the pettiness, the unshakable 
melancholy---she had 
found rationales [[rationalizations ]] for 
them, they had seemed so natural to her. 
But humans were not rational creatures---
they were all to [[o]] 
susceptible to the whims of their emotions. 

"Call a psychic hazard team," she 
said, pushing herself unsteadily to her feet. 
"Have them prepare an isolation ward. 
Immediately!"

---

The winds howled fiercely. Unrelentingly 
they bore down upon him 
with such strength he was sure could whittle 
twisting flesh from brittle bone.

There would be no reprieve this time, somehow 
he could tell. Too long had he delayed 
the destiny he had been chosen for. There 
would be consequences soon, more dire 
than simple marks upon his back. But 
even so, stubbornly, he refused to give in. 
Even if his 
flesh was rent away and his 
bones were turned to dust, he would 
not step away---he would not let her 
die---

His dreams were no longer merely 
dreams anymore---they had began 
to straddle the line between waking 
and sleep. It seemed these days Sebastian 
kept a foot in each, never fully awake 
nor asleep. Though in dreams, 
some part of him was still 
awake and awake enough to alert 
him that some presence had entered 
the room.

He roused himself, trying to slough off 
the heaviness of sleep as he rose 
from bed. Whoever was in 
the cell within him had not spoken 
yet [[was waiting for him, not speaking]].

"Hello?" he asked, rubbing the sleep 
from his eyes. "Dr. Alto?"


There was no response.  
[[P] By now Sebastian knew he was awake but 
the tree refused 
to let his vision go. He groped 
his hands along the sheets, but he saw 
only the stone of the gate, the empty sky. 

"Is...is someone 
there?" His voice sounded strangely 
small and far away. "Please, I can't---
I can't see anything. I can't---"

The vista of the stone precipice 
began to blur. Sebastian grabbed 
at the bed as his head began to spin 
with disorientation, hoping desperately 
to see the real world again. But 
instead, the stone gave way to 
darkness, interspersed with strange 
spheres of dim light. As the spheres 
grew more numerous, and their light 
glowed more brightly, Sebastian 
saw tendrils stretch between 
them, long and pale, 
having never seen the sun. As they 
reached outward into the dark, 
they split again and again, 
until they were so fine that their 
substance became nothing [[stretched into the very fabric of matter itself]]

They were branches, he realized. 
The branches of the world tree.

"Who's there?" he asked, eyes 
filled with the light of its luminous 
fruit. "Dr. Alto? Is that you? Can you help me?"

(( The shift from precipice => 
world tree should happen while 
he's dreaming ))

"No, Sebastian. It's me."

Despite his growing fear, and blindness, 
Sebastian felt a wash of relief at the 
sound of her voice. 

"Erika, thank god. Are you alright? 
I---I can't see you. Please, please tell 
me that you're alright."

"I'm fine, Sebastian." he heard 
her say. "I'm glad to see that you 
are too."

Despite his blindness, Sebastian 
stretched his legs out 
to touch the ground. Carefully,
he began to make his way across 
the cell, grasping blindly for the glass 
of the wall. 

"I'm sorry," he said. "I couldn't 
get away. I saw your car, crashed, and 
somehow I got turned around, but I was 
so tired I---:

"It's fine, Sebastian. It 
will be okay."

"They asked me to cooperate with 
them," he said. "To augur for them. 
They said they might even take me 
back home. But I can't---because 
if I tell them, you'll---"

Sebastian's fingers brushed against the 
cool glass. Feeling lost and drifting [[among...]], 
unable to see anything but the winding 
branches of the world tree, he pressed 
himself against the solidity of the 
surface. 

"You should do what's best for yourself, 
Sebastian. Don't worry about me."


"You don't need to worry about me."

There was a hint of sadness in her 
voice, immediately and intensely 
familiar to Sebastian. His blood 
suddenly ran cold. 

"Why not, Erika? What's wrong?" 
His mind fought 
to clear itself of the heaviness of 
its dreams, the panic of blindness. 
There was something wrong. "How---
how are you here, Erika? 
Did someone bring 
you here?"

"No. I'm on my own," she said, 
voice quiet. "Listen, Sebastian. I'm 
leaving. I didn't want to tell 
you, but I promised you before, that 
I wouldn't disappear on you, not 
without saying goodbye."

"What do you 
mean, leaving? Where are you going?"

"I can't tell you," she said. "
You should forget about 
me. Just, get out of this 
place as soon as you can. There will be 
a way out soon. Just run 
as far as you can---don't try to 
find me."

"Where are you going, Erika? Tell 
me! Let me come with you!"

"I...wish I could, Sebastian. But I 
can't. I have to go without you."

"You'll leave me here alone 
again?" He could feel his eyes 
cloud with tears, but the vision 
of the tree, its branches 
sprawling in the darkness, remained 
crystal clear. 

"I...have 
to go alone," she said. "You...you'd try 
to stop me. It's better this way."

Suddenly, it was clear. 
For months, the feeling of the a storm 
brewing in the distance, the terrible 
anticipation of disaster just over the horizon
it was coming to pass. Sebastian felt the 
certainty in deep in the core of his 
being, in his blind eyes, in his 
torn flesh. 

He slammed his fist against the 
glass, as ineffectual in real life 
as in the dream. "Why? Why 
do you have to go? 
Why 
can't you just stay here with 
me? It doesn't matter where, 
even locked up 
in this cell is fine---as long as 
you don't go."

"It's too late, Sebastian. I...shouldn't 
have spoken to you. I just wanted you 
to know that... ((no matter what it looks 
like, it was good. This world, this life. 
I'd do it all again if I could, I just can't 
bear it all anymore. I used to just push it 
all away, all the horrible things, just 
pretended that it was all happening to 
someone else. 
Because it was. But now---I don't 
know how you can stand it, Sebastian. But 
I know that I can't.)) 
So this is goodbye, Sebastian. 
I'm sorry that it didn't work out, the two of us. But we both knew it never would."

Her voice grew quieter, though the distance between them were growing to unbridgeable distances. 

"I wish I could see you," he said, pressing his face the glass. "I wish this didn't have to happen."

"I'm sorry, Sebastian, it already has."

And as her voice faded beyond a whisper, the vision clouding his eyes lifted. Sebastian found himself crouched against the glass wall, alone in an empty room. 

---

Not long after, an armed escort came to fetch him from his cell. With no explanation, they marched him from his room, through the winding halls of the facility. Unlike the Gallery, the halls were well lit. Guards were stationed at regular intervals from vantage points were
they could watch over whole 
blocks at once. 

They brought him to a conference 
room, located several 
floors above his cell, in a section 
of the building obviously intended 
for administrative purposes. The 
guards held him outside the door 
for a moment while the meeting 
within came to a close. 

The door opened. Out filed a long 
line of men and women, all bearing 
grave expressions and 
murmuring in low voices among themselves. 
Sebastian caught 
snippets of their speech. 
"Class A calamities", "potentially world-wide 
affects."

Once the crowds dispersed, the guards 
let him into the room. Much to his 
surprise, the [[y]] excuses themselves, letting 
Sebastian into the room 
unaccompanied. 

Dr. Alto was waiting for him there, 
along with two others Sebastian didn't 
recognize. One by 
his dress and manner seemed to a be 
a fellow researcher. The other, though, 
wore a gun at his 
belt, and sized up Sebastian as 
soon as he entered the room, clearly 
evaluating him for threats. 

"Is this H-994?" he asked. 

"Yes, though he prefers to be called 
Sebastian," said Dr. Alto. "Please 
sit down."

"I don't recall agreeing to help 
you," said Sebastian, still standing. 

"Unfortunately we no longer have 
the luxury of asking for your cooperation. 
At this point, if you refuse we will move 
to interrogation. But I thought that 
you would be amenable to a gesture 
of good will. Will you join us at the 
table?"

Sebastian, uncertainly, sat down 
in the nearest chair. The rest, seated 
at the other end of the room, looked 
down at him. Despite Alto's 
assurances, Sebastian could help 
but feel he was about to be 
interrogated anyways. * This is Dr so and so

"What's going on?" he asked. 

"Four hours ago, we had 
a containment breach," said Dr. 
Alto. "H-793, your friend, the 
Empath."

Sebastian felt his throat dry. "I don't 
have anything to do with it," he said. 

"No, but according to this prophecy 
from three years ago, you did 
foresee it, even if you forgot about it."

Alto slid a stack of papers 
to him from across the table. Sebastian 
recognized the notes from 
Bedlam hospital. 

"We picked them from Dr. Bedlam 
after the cult's raid. 
For better or for worse 
you were the only one of any interest to 
us at that facility. 

In the records of the wounds on his 
back, several had been circled. The 
one Doctor. Alto had 
was referring to was at the top of 
the page. 

"Hate for the false mother brings 
four from the true parent." [[???]]

"I never understood that one," 
said Sebastian. "I thought it was talking 
about my own parents."

"At this point, I think we can safely 
assume any unaccounted prophecies 
refer to the incident at hand," said Dr. 
Alto. "According to our predictions, there 
won't be much of any thing
happening after this."

"So then you did foresee this?" 
Dr. Baer complained. "You could have 
prevented all this from happening by 
just shooting the girl."

"I have over 900 artifacts, entities, 
and humanoids in my charge," Dr. 
Alto said, raising his voice. "Between 
them it's more likely for any given day to 
be the end of the world than not. 
Which doesn't help when you try to 
get funding to investigate when 
a good 10% of them start predicting 
cataclysmic disasters. None of 
which could actually say where 
or why," sighed Dr. Alto. 

"Sorry," interrupted Jared, 
speaking for the first time. "
Did you say it was H-793 
that breached containment? Isn't she 
only a level 2 security risk?" [[ only a euclid/safe ]]

"You must have an outdated version 
of her file," said Dr. Baers. "Here's 
the latest version." He handed 
Jared another sheaf of papers, offering 
another copy to Sebastian. 

"Ah," said Jared, lifting
the top sheet. "Class A. [[Keter. With a xyz provision]] That's bad, 
then."

"Very bad," agreed Dr. Baers. "I 
((Jared comes in w/ S.)) 
could let the two of you read the 
report, but perhaps it would be faster 
to just show you the relevant 
footage from the breach."

Dr. Alto fiddled with the controls 
to the projector while Baers walked up
to the front. 

"This is the fMRI lab, Room B9-
781. Four and a half hours ago. The 
two you see are Dr. Weaver 
and Dr. Anderson, the two chief 
scientists of the lab of superneural studies, 
in my department," said Dr. Baers. 
"On the gurney is H-973."

[[ TODO: fix all the numbers ]]

Sebastian watched the two figures 
on the screen mill about. Of Erika 
could see only her chest and legs, 
strapped down to the bed of the machine. 
His heart squeezed uncomfortably 
in his chest. 

"They were supposed to perform 
a contact test---authorized and expected, 
given the patient's unusual reaction to 
skin-to-skin contact. However, 
Dr. Weaver then makes an unauthorized 
decision to perform the test herself 
when their allotted D-class is delayed."

"Death row prisoners," Dr. Alto 
explained. "Exposing humans to potentially 
deadly situations is an unfortunate 
necessity at times. We offer prisoners 
an indefinitely stay of their sentences 
if they agree to work with us."

Sebastian, after his initial 
reaction of horror, felt a twinge 
of empathy for the prisoners. 

"So the test proceeds," said Dr. 
Baers. "Unfortunately, Dr. Weaver and 
H-973 have a history---she objected 
strongly to returning to the project, but 
I insisted. After Dr. Phillip's passing 
there was no one left from the original 
project," Dr. Baers shook his head. 
"Perhaps if I had listened to her, 
all of this could have been avoided."

"Peace, Georgi, 
there is much we could have done differently."

"Too true," he said. "The 
test seems to proceed as planned, but 
only for a moment."

On the screen, Dr. Weaver reached 
out to touch Erika. Sebastian saw 
her strain to break free, falling still 
as soon as contact was made. The man, 
Gillian, was speaking to the woman, 
but stopped suddenly. An expression of 
rage, at odds with his otherwise 
meek demeanor, came across his face. 
With a howl of fury, he ran at 
Weaver, pinning her to the wall as 
he attempted to strangle her. Behind 
them, Erika's body thrashed on 
the gurney. 

"The whole incident lasted 
less than a minute. Dr. Weaver 
manages to free herself and immediately 
calls for a psychohazard team. She 
and Anderson and the 
rest of the technicians evacuate 
the area."
"So what happened here?" asked 
Jared. "Suddenly the Empath starts 
controlling other people's emotions? 
That's not typically an empath thing, 
is it?" 

"H-793 was never your typical 
empath," said Dr. Baers. "We 
encounter reports of empathic abilities 
on a fairly regular 
basis. Most cases are barely more 
than individuals with unusually [[compulsive people pleasers with an unusually high emotional IQ]]
high emotional IQ and compulsive 
people pleasers. We tend to let them 
go, since they're essentially 
harmless. But H-793 seems to be 
something else entirely."

"Then what was she?"

Dr. Baers smiled grimly. "We'll 
get to that in a moment. 
Unfortunately the incident isn't over 
yet."

(( Maybe finish the incident description first. ))

"It's not?The psychohazard team 
should be more than capable of taking 
care of this kind of thing."


"Unfortunately the psychohazard team 
never makes it down," said Baers. 
"Dr. Alto, do you have footage of 
the PsyHaz barracks?"

"I do," he said. The screen 
cut to a frame of men and 
women dressing, 
putting strange suits of bulky fabric. 
No, not a freeze frame S. 
realized. The subjects of the shot 
were not fully still---they 
shifted from foot to foot, their 
gazes drifted slowly along the blank 
walls. They were awake and aware, 
but wiped of all thought or 
emotion. 

Sebastian recognized the blankness 
in their eyes. 
It was the same 
as Erika's when 
someone had touched 
her. 

[[ the psychohazard barracks are x miles away from here ]]

"All through out the facility," he said. 
"It's all like this. For eighteen 
and a half minutes, complete stillness."

Dr. Alto flicked through footage
of rooms throughout the facility---
laboratories, mess halls, even 
cells, every person was 
unmoving, unaware.

"We were lucky that 
there were only twelve subsequent 
breaches. Our casualties, too, 
were unexpectedly low."

"How many?" asked Jared.

"Only one. Dr Weaver," said 
Dr. Baers with great sadness. "Dr. 
Alto, would you take us back to 
the MRI room?"

Alto nodded. In the camera, 
Erika was still strapped to the 
bed of the machine. She had fallen 
still, as if also seized by the same 
blankness affecting the rest of the 
facility, but not for long. The door 
opened. In stepped Dr. Weaver + Gillian. Her 
movements were not quite clumsy, but 
not quite coordinated either. [[ Gillian moves clumsily, Weaver looks almost like herself]] They 
unstrapped Erika from the table, then 
stood still again. 

Erika, unsteady, sat up on 
the gurney. For a few moments, 
she sat their [[there]] unmoving, holding 
her head in her hands. 

She pushed herself off the bed, 
stumbling a little on unsteady legs. 
Beside her, Gillian 
pulled a gun from his waist, 
offering it to her [[ with mechanical hands]]. Erika pulled 
unresisting 
from his hand. Beside her, Weaver 
lowered herself on to her knees. 

"That's enough," said Dr. Baers, voice trembling. 
"You get the point. From here, 
she just walks out the facility. 
All locks, passcodes, biometrics, 
there is always someone to open 
them for her. Takes a car and 
drives off. All under 20 minutes. 

[[ boxed ]]
Only when she gets approximately 
5 kilometers out does the facility 
come back to life. The 
radius of effect has been 
increasing since. Our best 
estimate is at least 55 km."

[[ cross ]] She could take out 
a small city by just being there," 
said Jared. 

"Luckily she seems 
to have no interest," said 
Dr. Baers. "She has been 
staying away from any 
major population centers, 
which, while good for avoiding 
panic, has made it significantly 
more difficult to track her." [[end cross]]

"Well, with one exception," 
said Dr. Alto. "During our 18 minutes 
of silence, the only activity in 
the facility was localized around H-793 
and one other place. Your cell."

The footage cut to Sebastian's 
cell. He saw himself stumble blindly 
out of bed, groping at the glass. 
He felt his eyes begin to sting. 

There was one on the other 
side. There never had been. 

"It's not quite right to say that you 
were the only one unaffected," said Dr. 
Baers. "But in the entire facility, only 
you maintained some semblance of self."

They watched as he spoke to an empty 
room, banged his fists against the glass. 
The same anger and grief bubbled up inside 
him again. 

"Whether it's some element of your 
affliction that caused it, or whether she 
chose to spare you, we cannot say. But 
at this point, you are the only person 
who can possibly get near enough to 
stop her. 

((What is love, anyways? 

It's the feeling that in a 
world where anything can be taken from 
you at a moment's notice, that there is 
something worth holding on to. ))

"What do you mean?" asked Sebastian. 

"The radius of affect is 
growing. Activity didn't return to the facility 
until she was 5km away, and it's been 
growing since. Our last estimate puts the 
nearest we can get to her at 15 km."

[[ cross]]
"Do we know where she's going?"

"We have theories," said Dr. Alto. 
"But among us, someone may know 
with some more certainty."

The table turned to look to Sebastian. 
"The world tree," he said quietly. 

"It's hard to say what will happen 
when she arrives. However, in the 
short time that we did have custody 
over her, we did get some 
insight, thanks to Dr. Weaver."

Baers replaced the security footage 
with a set of graphs of peaks 
and spikes. It was meaningless to 
Sebastian ((maybe they actually didn't know))

"They were only testing for maximum 
range of affect, but Dr. Weaver had 
the insight to secure use of an atomic 
caliber clock. Assuming no operator or 
mechanical error, these results show 
that transmission is instantaneous---
violating the principal of locality---
the speed of light," he clarified 
for Jared + Sebastian. 



"That's impossible, isn't it?" asked Jared. 

"But more common than 
you'd think," agreed Baers. "I'm no 
expert, but usually when we encounter 
violations of locality, it is because the 
two bodies are the same thing---
the two physical existences are 
manifestations of the same entity. 
We've only had one opportunity 
to truly study this phenomena in depth, 
but unfortunately this opportunity 
was cut short. What we have Notes are attached 
at the end of H-793's file."

Sebastian flipped through the packet, 
trying not to read the details of the 
litany of tests they had subjected Erika 
to in the brief time she was here. 
At the end of the packet, in an older 
typeface, Sebastian recognized the 
authors' names. 

"Bertholt and Freeman? From the cult? 
They were part of the Foundation?"

"Not quite," said Dr. Alto. "
We often 
sponsor other institutions to investigate 
strange phenomena if it's unlikely to 
be paranormal and has 
low levels of risk. Drs Bertholt and 
Freeman were from 
the Chicago Institute of Agricultural 
Sciences---we sent them to investigate 
an usually robust ecosystem. 
When things started to 
[[go]] wrong, we failed to realize exactly 
how much of it was due to E-1448 
and before we knew it Dr. Bertholt 
was dead and Dr. Freeman had 
started that damn cult of his."

"He's dead, now," said Sebastian, 
quietly. 

"That's unfortunate," said Dr. Baers.
 "He was the only person 
remaining who might 
have been able to 
say 
what will happen when H-793 reaches 
the world tree."

[[ the integration and exchange ]]

"Well, I could tell you that," 
said Dr. Alto. "
Prophets are predicting an end to humanity [[cataclysmic shift to the nature of humanity]], 
though the rest of the earth should remain 
unaffected. Humankind not even be 
wiped out---it will just be irrevocably 
changed, made silent, like this facility 
was [[if I were to guess]]."

"Only temporarily, then?" said Jared, 
hopefully. 

"We cannot say," said Dr. Baers. "But 
Unfortunately we 
must defer to Dr. Bertholt's expertise 
here. If H-793 reception of other's 
thoughts and emotions at superluminal 
speeds, then she must be 
the representation of those 
thoughts and emotions. [[avatar]] Dr. Bertholt 
theorized that such an entity existed, 
but who would have thought 
that the entity would have a mind and 
[[double and ]] and thoughts of its own."

Sebastian recalled Erika's doubts, 
about who she was when no one else was 
around, and about whether she 
was anything more than the aggregation 
of the way others felt around her. 
In the past weeks, he'd almost forgot
about them, as if they had never been 
a question at all. 

"Even if it's only temporary," 
said Dr. Alto, 
"We will still likely see 
an unprecedented level of disaster. 
Lore says the world tree 
connects all living things, 
providing balance among the world's 
various species. Extrapolating 
from Dr. Bertholt's research, we can 
assume that it is the symbolic 
representation of this harmony. 
Given that we're currently 
undergoing a massive extinction 
due solely to 
human activity, we can probably 
assume that humankind is not included 
in this bond, at least not on a conscious 
level. But that will likely come 
to an end if H-793 
comes into contact with the world 
tree. The end of conscious thought 
that the prophecies predict 
likely refers to the absorption of 
conscious thought into the world 
tree's domain. Even if we do 
regain our own thoughts they're unlikely 
to be unchanged."

"It sounds a bit shaky to me," said 
Jared. "All of this is assuming that 
she is actually headed to the world tree. 
How do 
you know that's where she's going?"

"I..." Sebastian paused. "I just do. I've 
known it for a long time."

"In any case, 
this hypothesis seems to fit in line with 
what other sources of knowledge 
about the future. At the very least it's 
worth sending a team out to the site 
to intercept her when she arrives. 
Even ((Other people should be 
in the room during this conversation. 
Also, Alto's hypothesis about the world 
tree is regarded as nonsensical; they're not 
operating with the Foundation's 
approval. )) Mr. Olsen, this will 
be the responsibility of your team. 
Even if we are powerless when 
she arrives, there must be some things 
we can do to prepare."

"I can think of a few 
nasty traps to catch her by surprise," 
he replied. 

"Keep in mind that our normal 
approach to psychic containment has 
traditionally been ineffective. 
Things may have changed now that her powers 
are not only receptive. I would consult with 
Drs..."

Sebastian found himself fading fast from 
the conversation as they discussed the 
various ways they might kill her. The 
anger at his own inffectuality 
seemed to roar up in 
his ears, mingling with visions of 
uncanny clarity of the violence they were 
willing to inflict on her to keep her from 
reaching the world tree. 

Why was he here? What did they want from him?

"Sebastian?"

At some point, Olsen and his 
men had left. Sebastian had hardly noticed. 
Subconsciously 
he had wrapped his arms around his 
stomach. He pulled them away now, 
to find them covered in blood. 

"Jeez, are you okay?"

Suddenly lightheaded, Sebastian 
felt himself slowly entering [[??]] in his seat.
"All under 20 minutes. Now she's 
headed north. Our teams are trying to retrieve 
her, but at this point, no one can 
get within 20km of her."

"That was four hours ago," 
said Dr. Alto. "Unfortunately they lost 
track of her within the last hour 
when she left such densely 
populated areas such that they 
could track her by the silence [[lack of activity]] 
around  her."

"If you're asking me to help you 
find her so you can drag her back 
here to be used as lab rat, I refuse."

"You know as well as I that there's 
much more at stake than that," 
said Dr. Alto.

((blah blah silence all thoughts ))
Sebastian pressed a hand against 
where the wound was on his chest, 
closed but still refusing to heal. 

"During the incident, the entire facility 
was frozen. The only exception," said 
Dr. Baers. "Dr. Alto, would you show 
us the feed?"

On the screen, Sebastian saw 
himself rise from the bed and stumble
to the glass. His voice in the recording 
was thin and riddled with distortion. 
He watched himself beg her to stay [[and]] 
throw himself against the glass. The 
same feeling of powerlessness clutched 
at his chest. The room was empty, 
it always had been.

"You thought you were speaking with 
her," said Dr. Alto. "What did she 
tell you?"

It's better this way.

"She didn't tell me anything," said 
Sebastian. 

"If you refuse to cooperate, we will 
move to the interrogation room," said 
Dr. Alto. "Where did she go?" he 
said forcefully. 

"She didn't tell me!" Sebastian 
said. He grabbed 
his knees to keep his hands from 
shaking. "She didn't tell me anything. 
She only wanted to say goodbye."

"Even if she didn't tell you, you 
know, don't you?"

Sebastian said nothing. (( They could 
compel him to speak. They could torture 
him, drug him, but nothing more than 
what his body was doing to himself.))

"Time is past for these petty 
loyalties, Sebastian," said Dr. Alto. 
"The whole of humanity is at stake. Who 
is her parent? Where is she going?"

"She didn't even bother taking 
you with her when she escaped," said 
Jared, though he seemed to regret 
it as soon as he had. 

"You can't run from these things 
forever," said Dr. Alto. 


"You can't run from these things forever," said 
Dr. Alto. "That first prophecy ever, do you 
remember what it said?"

"I...could never forget," said Sebastian. He 
touched the skin over his chest. Though it had healed 
long ago, the scar remained, like a brand over 
his heart. 

((should compile a list of these things and think 
hard about them so they suck less))

"And sword raised, love is slain beneath the 
tree of leaves."

[ From the start, he had always known that 
everything he had 
done, saving her, being saved, loving her, 
being loved, all was little more than the machinations 
of fate, to bring him to the moment where he could 
strike her down. 
Trying to run away from it, trying to live out their 
lives in peace had only brought them 
to the end faster. If 
only he had been strong enough to leave her 
behind, but somehow the thought scared him more than 
death. So he had feigned ignorance, 
paying present happiness for future heartbreak, 
pretending to deny fate while stumbling into 
it headlong. ]

The harder you try and avoid destiny, the 
harder it will hold you. 
"She's...going to the place where she came from," Sebastian said. 
"To the world tree."

"The world tree?" 
echoed Dr. Alto. "Do you know which one?"

(( This is hilariously anticlimactic. I 
have no idea how to fix it))

[[ also, the world tree is the scp's records, so they presumably should know which one. ]]

"There's more than one?" said Sebastian. 

"There are as many mythological trees as there 
are cultures to have mythos," said Dr. Alto. 
"I can think of a half dozen under our 
guardianship just off the top of my head," 
said Dr. Baers. "And I 
rarely deal with anything outside 
of the H class."

Sebastian shook his head. "I don't know 
where it is. I only know about it from 
the prophecies."

Dr. Alto consulted the computer. "Our results show 
over 200 tree-like entities. And these are 
only the ones that we know of. You don't know 
anything else about this world tree?"

"I know it's like her," Sebastian said, 
reaching for Bedlam's records of 
his prophecies. He was momentarily staggered 
by the sheer number of them. 
So many had come and 
go without any notice from him.

"An Empath?" asked Jared. "is that a 
thing a tree can be?"

"Well, H-793 wasn't exactly an Empath," 
said Dr. Baers. "We actually come across 
Empaths with some regularity. Most are 
little more than compulsive people pleasers 
with unusually high emotional intelligence. 
We let them go because they're essentially 
harmless. H-793 is about as far from that as she can be. We could never detect the 
means of her extrasensory perception---
not even full electromagnetic shielding could 
turn it off. Even the strongest of psychics 
become ineffectual behind 100ft of 
concrete. I'm starting to think we had her 
under the wrong department all this time."

"The infinitesimal 
boughs,', 'its cloying branches,' 
if we assume all the references to tree-like 
things words describe this world tree..."

"Is it just me, or does 'tree of leaves' 
seem like a particularly unhelpful name?' 
said Jared, also rifling through Sebastian's 
file.

"It...doesn't have leaves," said Sebastian, 
suddenly recalling 
the vision that had blinded him. "It lives 
in the dark."

"Well, then that's extremely unhelpful," 
muttered Jared.

(( He doesn't realize he's seeing the tree when he has the vision ))

"How do you know all this?" Dr. Alto asked 
him curiously. "There's nothing that would 
suggest any of this in the prophecies."

"Erika, she---"

Sebastian gripped the table as a sudden 
wave of dizziness washed over 
him. A twitch of irritation deep within a 
healing wound suddenly became a full fledged 
stab of pain. Sebastian pressed an arm into 
his stomach as the cloth began to stain 
with blood. 

The others in the room 
jumped in alarm, Dr. Baers rushing to the 
intercom for assistance, Jared to 
catch him as he fell. 

"Jesus, Christ, that's a lot of blood." 
Jared's voice seemed far off as Sebastian 
felt himself drifting into unconsciousness. 
He tried to focus his eyes on the faces
above him, but 
the harder he tried to focus, the faster they 
seemed to cloud with fog.

"Are you alright, Sebastian?" Dr. Alto's 
voice seemed to echo, sound swallowed by 
the vast distances of the 
tower of stone. 

As Sebastian slipped back again into 
the haze of dreams, he saw Dr. Alto lift 
his shirt to see the wound, quickly pooling 
with blood. Though his vision was fast 
fading, he saw the wounds in perfect 
clarity. 

We will see each other again.

(( He should try to do something to stop 
them from finding Erika, 
and then the curse punishes him for it. 
1. He realizes Erika told him this
2. He tries to deny it, that he was 
mistaken ))

---


((A brief interlude from Erika's perspective? ))

* He'd assumed that the dream had been his, but 
maybe not. He had hallucinated her 
voice, hallucinating a vision wasn't any 
stranger. And the blindness had never happened 
before. Maybe the vision was not his, but 
Erika's. But then why show him just to 
say goodbye?

"I... no, nevermind. I was mist---"

---


I feel driven to write this to the end, 
and I don't really understand why, 
or if it's even what I want.

---

Sebastian at last was successful in waking himself from the 
cycle of dreams, though the pain in his 
stomach almost drove him back into his 
consciousness, radiating outwards into the 
network of old scars. By now it was 
obvious---if he deviated from the plan 
they had set from, he would be punished, 
whether by pain or sleep.

We will see each other again.

The foundation had noticed that 
he was awake. The door opened. Sebastian 
expected Dr. Alto, but instead it was 
Jared. Sebastian pushed himself upright.

"You don't need to get up," he said 
quickly, [[noticing how the movement contorted his face with pain]] "I'm just here to drop off some 
documents Dr Alto said might be of 
interest to you." 

He opened the door's tiny drop box, 
a good walk across the cell and hesitated. 
"Actually, do you mind if I come in?" 

Sebastian shook his head. "Jared 
unlocked the door with keypass and 
combination pad. He noticed Sebastian's 
special attention to the process.

"Sorry," said Sebastian. "Bad habit."

"Er, no problem," said Jared.

"How long was I asleep?" Sebastian asked. 

"12 hours," he replied. "A lot has happened 
since then. They've found the 
world tree. They've sent 
teams out to intercept her." 

"How did they figure it out? 
Not just from what said, surely?" 
Sebastian said. 

"From several 
different places," said Jared. "But a 
leafless tree growing in the dark 
eliminated a lot of possibilities. 
Also, the results from the tests they ran 
on H-793 came in. Something about 
faster than light communication, or 
something," said Jared. "I didn't fully 
understand it. There's a write up in her records, 
if you'd like to see it."

Sebastian accepted the papers. 
Trying to sit up straight shot stabs of 
protest through his chest. Sebastian 
grit his teeth through them. 

"793- Humanoid - Empath"

"Security level: 2"

"Height: 5'8"

"Weight: 140 lbs" [[ SI these ]]


"Description. Female. Normal
human appearance. Race: 
apparently caucasian. Hair: black
Eyes: Blue Height, weight, DOB: 09/18/19XX."

Sebastian couldn't help but let out a 
breath of laughter. 

"Is something funny?" asked 
Jared.

"Not really," said Sebastian. "She was 
just completely wrong about her birthday."

He kept reading.

[[ I have a better version of all this somewhere. ]]

"Subject takes the appearance of a 
normal human female. No 
special containment measures are necessary, 
though staff with security clearance 3 
and above should 
maintain a minimum distance of 3m."

"H-793 was originally 
discovered in [REDACTED] following the 
murder of her mother in an armed 
robbery. There is no record of her father. 
Subject entered foster care briefly but was 
quickly returned to the state due to 
difficulties due to mental deficiencies. 
While at [REDACTED], subject attracted 
the attention of Appellagio Research 
Sciences for the rapid disappearance 
of aforementioned 
mental deficiencies, including learning to 
speak with a full vocabulary under a 
year. When Appellagio Research 
Sciences was folded into Foundation 
operations, subject was reclassified 
as an H-class abnormality.

((They initially thought she might 
be a super genius or something ))

"Subject is capable of perceiving 
emotions of humans within a radius 
of 50m, though specificity is lost 
with increasing distance. Subject is 
also capable of hearing the thoughts of 
any individual within 1m. If [[direct physical]]
contact is made with H-793, subject 
ceases to move or speak, though 
vital and autonomous behaviors will continue."

"When subject was obtained by the 
foundation at age 7, the maximum distance of 
response was measured to be 30 km. 
As subject has aged, 
said distance has increased roughly proportionally 
to other growth metrics (see figure A-5) 
until reaching current levels. Maximum 
distance of response was measured by 
exposing subject to stimuli that excite the..."


Sebastian swallowed the lump in his throat, suddenly feeling sick. He lowered the packet. There were pages and pages of minutia about the years and years of testing she had been subjected to as a child.

"Are you okay?" asked Jared. "There's a lot---you can take a break or whatever. I can come back later."

"No, I'm fine," said Sebastian. "It's just, grim stuff. I don't know what I expected though. Maybe a funny story, or something?"

"Most of it's not relevant. You can 

skip to the end," said Jared.

Sebastian flipped through the pages 
until he came across a section printed 
in newer typeface. It was dated 
for the day before. 

"Upon re-entering H-793 
was subjected to the following tests:
- salivary gland remote stimulation
- and so on so forth

See appendix I-83 for details.

Neural responses were recorded with 
nanosecond precision with an atomic 
clock. Synchronized clocks were also used to 
time both the source of the stimulus and 
H-793. The data gathered shows that 
stimulus and subject reaction occur 
simultaneously, even at distances 
greater than 400m. Effect is 
reproducible across multiple sessions. 
Assuming no operator or machine error, 
this implies H-793's perceptions 
of other's emotional states
violates the principle of 
locality, occurring faster than allowed 
by the speed of light. 

Instantaneous communication has 
been observed several 
times, but only studied in depth once by Drs. Bertholt + Freeman 
in their investigation of E-1447 
(Heart of the Monoculture)."

Sebastian looked up to Jared. "
Bertholt and Freeman worked for 
the Foundation?"

"That's the guy who started the cult?" asked 
Jared. "No, he was never part of the Foundation, 
exactly. They must have been 
one of our sponsored research groups. They 
do that 
sometimes, when it's probably nothing."

"It wasn't nothing, 
that time," said Sebastian. 
"Usually things don't go quite that 
wrong."

Sebastian returned to reading. 

"Dr. Bertholt hypothesized that the 
violation of relativity could only occur 
if the two entities in communication 
were not in actuality separate 
entities---simply two manifestations
of the same phenomena. In the case of 
E-1447 the instantaneous response of 
the root system to changes in the 
field as a whole was a consequence 
of cornfield and roots being a mutual manifestation 
of the monoculture. Extrapolating from 
this hypothesis, we can only assume that 
H-793 is a manifestation of the thoughts 
and emotions around it. Thus 
incident 793-K 
must be a consequence of H-793 
becoming capable of its own thoughts and 
emotions." [[and override that which she was only meant to represent ]]

[[
"They found another one like them," 
said Jared. "H-793 and E-1447. ]]
[[Underground, in the shape of a tree. No leaves, just like you said."

"It could be the wrong one," said Sebastian, but he didn't believe it.

Jared pulled a chair over and sat down. "I'm afraid not. The lore of the local people is that it maintains the balance between all living things. When they found it, they cross referenced the tree's recorded activity--each time the tree bloomed there was some sort of extinction event somewhere in the world. And then two hours ago, we got reports that the Temple of the Unified Mind was headed in the same direction. If there was any question, they were answered now." ]]

"So then they've gone to find her. They'll lay traps and try and [[try to ]]
pick her off from afar," said Sebastian, 
collapsing his head in his hands. "
If they catch her, will they bring her back 
here?"

"Probably not," said Jared. "At this 
point, she's too hard to contain. And 
Dr. Alto thinks that if she does come into 
contact with the world tree, the 
effect of her powers will be amplified---
the entire world will be go 
silent, just like this facility did [[was]]. They won't 
take that risk."

Sebastian wanted to sink 
down into his bed. His limbs, his heart, 
his head, felt all as heavy as lead. There 
was no question---Dr. Alto's prophets said 
as much, so did the wounds in his own 
chest. He thought that the time they had 
spent together, letting her be her 
own person, might have delayed the 
inevitable, but it seemed that it only 
hastened it. 

"Why...why did he want me to read 
this?" he said. 
"I think he still wants your cooperation," 
said Jared "After all this, H-793 isn't 
what you think she is. She might have seemed 
human to you, but she was probably never more than 
just a vessel for what people were 
thinking and feeling around her. That's the 
first thing they teach you when dealing 
with the H-class. We'll personify 
a teakettle, it's impossible not to try 
and personify a 
humanoid. But in the end, they 
don't think like us, they never will."

"Bullshit," said Sebastian, but with 
more exasperation than venom. "If that were 
the case we wouldn't be having this 
problem right now."

"So even if she was her own person, 
in the end, what has 
she done? Executed a woman, 
and then abandoned you here? You don't 
owe her anything. It's easier if you 
just forget about her," said Jared.

(( Maybe it's someone he knew from before. 
Maybe Maya? Maybe a friend? ))

"She said the same thing," he said quietly. 

Jared took the papers from where they 
were falling from Sebastian's grip and 
set them on the table for him later. 

"What exactly was she to you, Sebastian? 
A friend? A lover?"

Sebastian let out a pained 
laugh. "That's the trouble, isn't it? In 
different circumstances, she could have been 
either, or both. I can see it, so clearly
---the way things could have turned out. But 
I could never find a way to get there. 
Instead, here we 
are, just prisoners who got a taste of freedom 
together."

Jared watched him lower himself 
gingerly back to bed, chest heaving with 
exertion at even that simple effort. 

"Sebastian," he said. "This 
developing her own thoughts, it probably 
didn't happen all at once. 
The only reason you feel so attached to her is 
because of her influence on you."

Sebastian said nothing. Jared 
stood and locked the cell behind him. 
Sebastian waited until he left the 
room. 

"That's how love works, isn't it?"

((Either that, or he says "you're wrong" 
before Jared walks out. ))

((Next scene, everything fails, S 
persuades J to take him out))

((Eh, back to delaying the inevitable, 
write some other scenes ))

Sebastian at last stumbled into town. 
It was eerily quiet. 
Hours ago there had been gunshots, not 
in itself unusual, but the rattle of several 
automatic weapons had cracked through the 
valley like thunder. Sebastian wondered if 
the townspeople noticed or cared.

The door to the library swung
open. It was Mrs. Grady. She seemed 
surprised to see him.

"What are you doing out here? You poor 
thing, you look like you've been dragged 
through the mud."

"Mrs. Grady, have you seen Erika?" 
he said, staggering to his feet. 
Mrs. Grady rushed over to steady him.

"Sorry, who?" she repeated. 

"Erika," he said. 
"My...wife. 
Dark hair, dark eyes. Standoff-ish. Always 
wearing gloves?"

None of this seemed to strike any 
chord of recognition with Mrs. 
Grady. 

"Well, sir, I don't think you and I 
have been introduced properly, 
never mind your wife!" she said. "Won't 
you come on in, we'll get you cleaned 
up, and see if anyone's seen her, 
does that sound okay to you, honey?"

Sebastian backed away. "What are 
you talking about, Mrs. Grady? 
We've been here for six months now. 
We've been living in the cabin down 
by the lake..."

"The old Witterman place? I've been 
hiring some of the village boys to keep 
the place in shape. No one's lived 
there in months."

"I...must have been mistaken, then," 
he said. "I've got to go."

((Getting really sick of these 
wake up in a cell, something happens 
scenes ))

His sleep was 
troubled by dreams of on oncoming 
wave. Spreading quickly and silently 
through the minds of humankind. 
As it broke over him, he 
was left with a horrifying 
numbness he 
himself could not feel, but understood 
by the oppressive 
silence that fell, hushed before him. 
Since sleep had no reprieve for him, 
he instead hid from his dreams in wakefulness. 
To keep 
himself from nodding off, he tried reading 
the books that they had placed on his 
shelf, but they did a poor job of 
holding his attention. Words passed
in front of his eyes without understanding. 
His mind, anxiously, drifted 
to the clock on the wall.

Jared said they had located the 
world tree four hours ago. Teams had 
been dispatched an hour after that. In 
16 hours there was only so far she could have 
gone by car. Two hours to 
catch up to her by plane, another hour 
to find her---Had they found her yet? 
Had they killed her? Was she 
already gone?

{ Sebastian was no stranger to loss. 
Orphaned at a young 
age, he became well acquainted with 
it before he was old enough to really 
understand it. And though if asked, he 
would insist that he had lived a 
normal life, the truth is that when 
loss reared its head 
later in life, he never 
truly forgot. Rather than lose them again, 
Sebastian would run. Run from his 
family to university, run from his 
friends to Bedlam---run until there 
was nothing to lose anymore. But 
somehow he had 
found something more to lose. 
He had let Erika into his life 
just to let her hurt 
him again. 

And really, had she ever done 
anything but hurt him? }

He threw aside the book and sat heavily 
by the table. He pried open the folder 
Jared had left him. Why was she doing 
this? Why oppress the minds and 
hearts around her? Why kill that woman? Why 
run to the world tree and consign humanity 
to an eternity of silence? Why leave him 
behind? Furiously, Sebastian read
through her notes, but was quickly awash 
in a sea of scientific jargon. What was 
understandable sketched out only a childhood 
of scientific torment and affectionless 
observation. There were no answers there. 
Surely there was more to it---just as 
surely there was more to her than their 
un?comfortable silences, the laconic quips, 
her unrelenting cynicism. 

But maybe in the end there was not. 
Maybe all he had seen in her was a mirror 
of himself, his best expectations and 
his worst fears. And now, he would let 
her die, like a stranger to him, a thousand 
miles apart. 

[[ Maybe she was only ever more than a stranger to him when she was by his side. And it would be as a stranger that she perished, the woman he knew already gone when she left him behind on the mountain road. ]]

But, as droplets of blood fell onto sheets 
of paper before him, she was not 
dead yet. The door of his cell as Sebastian 
stood, pressing a hand into his shoulder 
the quell the ache newly blossoming 
there. 

No hand shall touch her which she 
does not permit. 

"You couldn't stop her, I take it?" Sebastian 
said. 

"We've lost track of the entire," 
mission team," said Dr. Alto. "They're 
sending another, to intercept her at the 
world tree, but it's unlikely they'll be 
able to stop her."

"But you think I will?"

Alto's 
eyes were underset by deep bags. He 
was wearing the same suit as the 
last time Sebastian had seen him. 
His gaze lingered on the wound Sebastian 
was clutching at on his shoulder.

"I think at this point only you and I 
understand the urgency of the situation, and 
I'm willing to take risks to prevent 
the worst case scenario."

"Fine," he said. "I'll stop her. But in 
return I want my freedom. Unconditioned."

Alto sighed. "I'll have to talk to my superiors. 
But you have as much as my word. At minimum, 
we can get you freedom of movement 
with minimal observation. The details will 
have to wait until you get back."

"That's fine with me," Sebastian said. 
He stepped out from behind 
the table, preparing to following [[typo ]] Alto 
out the cell. 

"What about her?"

"What about her?" Sebastian echoed 
tonelessly. 

"Her freedom," said Dr. Alto. 
"You aren't going to 
bargain for it?"

Sebastian looked askance. "I 
failed to persuade her to stay 
here. I doubt I can persuade her to come back."

Dr. Alto let him out of the cell. 
His face was 
twisted with pain, but whether it 
was from the wound on his shoulder 
or some other source, he could not 
say. 

---

((Erika listens to music when she's 
stuck in close quarters ))

Transport was arranged in the guise of 
a facility transfer, approved 
at rapid pace by Dr. Alto himself. Within 
the hour. Sebastian found 
himself in a helicopter, flying
over the mountains and forests he had just 
left. 

Upon arriving, 
Jared 
had a brief argument with the 
head of the small facility, that was 
quickly settled by a phone call direct 
to Dr. Alto. Barely twenty minutes after 
landing, Jared 
had procured a vehicle and supplies 
for the next few days. 

"Sounds like the task force left 
just before we got 
here," said Jared. "They headed over by 
helicopter. They'll arrive long before 
we do, but it's risky. Get too close to 
her and they'll fall from the sky."

[[ They're worried about contamination, bring Jared in from a separate facility ]]

"Will we get there before she does?" 
asked Sebastian, from where he was tucked 
away in the back seat. He felt a little 
better since leaving the cell, but the 
helicopter ride had been taxing---the 
roar of wind was too reminiscent of the 
trials of his dreams. 

"It depends," said Jared, looking 
up. Above the sky hung heavy with 
clouds. There was a cool quality to the air 
that belied a storm. "
Depending on how far we get before the storm, we may arrive 
just as she does. But we'll still probably 
get caught in the eye. Sebastian, are 
you sure about this?"

Sebastian turned to look out the window. 
"Shouldn't I be asking you that?"

"I'm doing this because it's what I'm 
paid to do."

"Then I'm doing this for my freedom."

Jared sat in the driver's seat, 
sighing. "That doesn't 
exactly fill me with confidence that you 
won't brain me in the back of the head 
and then run off with the truck never to 
be seen again. 
We should have a full 
transport team. This is highly against 
regulations."

"It's because I 
insisted," said Sebastian. "I 
would have preferred to go alone."

"That's still not filling me with 
confidence that I won't end up dead 
in a ditch somewhere. Why 
did you change your mind?"

(( Why did he tell them in the first place? ))

It seemed that Sebastian would refuse to 
answer, but Jared refused to move the car 
until he did. At last, he said. 

"It's the right thing to do."

Jared scowled. "I guess that's as good as 
I'm going to get. 
But if I get the feeling that 'the 
right thing to do' includes running 
for the hills, I'll 
tranquilize you and take you back to the 
facility."

"You don't have to worry," said Sebastian. "I'll do 
as promised."

They set off down the mountain roads. 
Sebastian recognized the old growth 
trees, the colors and shapes of these 
hills. Perhaps it was no coincidence 
that the place Erika had chosen as 
their home was less than 
a day's drive from the world tree. 
From the 
Foundation's notes, 
he had learned that this particular incarnation 
of the world tree was said to maintain 
the balance of all living things on 
Earth. Local lore spoke of the leafless 
tree blooming in the advent of calamity 
and leaving fruit as old life died and new took 
its place. Tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, 
floods world wide had brought 
fruit to the ancient tree's boughs. 
Previous hypotheses had assumed it to 
be some guardian entity, but in light 
of the test run on Erika and the 
Heart of the Monoculture, it seemed 
more likely that it was instead 
only a physical manifestation of the 
world's ecosystem as a whole. 
They had not yet managed to confirm the 
superluminal communication between 
tree and ecosystem, but 
if there was a chance, said Dr. Alto, after all this, 
they would run tests at first opportunity. 
While there was no reason human 
beings should not have been included in 
this great cycle of life, it seemed 
unlikely. 
The anthropocene extinction claimed 
new species at a rate 
never seen before in the history 
of the Earth, with no end in sight. If 
humans were represented in the world tree's 
regulation, it was only at a subconscious level. 
Dr. Alto's theorized that 
the events to come, the erasure of 
superliminal thought for all of mankind 
would be a consequence of introducing 
the avatar of 
humankind's thoughts and emotions 
into the world tree's 
far reaching boughs. 

Though, maybe it would be for 
the best, if they failed to stop her. Mankind 
had done a poor job as stewards of the 
earth. Perhaps it was 
time to return it to its rightful owner. 

"Jared," said Sebastian, as he watched  
the scenery blur past. It seemed lately like 
his vision had started to go, shapes in the 
distance becoming indistinct. But there were odd 
patches in the scenery, somehow 
clearer than the rest, like a heat 
haze in reverse. "Do you believe in heroes 
and villains?"

"Hm, what was that?" said Jared, 
shaking himself from the meditative 
stupor of driving. Sebastian repeated the 
question. 

"It's a bit of a juvenile way of 
looking at the world, isn't it? But I guess 
we're all the heroes of our own stories, 
even if we're the villains in someone else's."

"Erika didn't believe in heroes 
or villains," he said. "Just selfishness, 
fear, guilt, and hormones."

"That's pretty bleak. I'd like to think that there's a 
little more to life than that," 
Jared replied. 

"I think so, too," said Sebastian. 
"But I don't know that Erika ever 
got her own story to feel like the hero 
of."

"She certain is the villain of a 
lot of people's," Jared said evenly. "Dr. 
Weaver's for one. Yours and 
mine too, if something goes wrong."

"Yeah," Sebastian agreed, and then 
let the rest of the ride continue in 
silence.

(( The the dream scene with the 
dreamer ))

((There is surprisingly 
[[little]] benefit to being invited to the hall 
of heroes. But at the least while you're 
here you can beat on the door of the gods. ))

---

(( Then the scene in the car ))

"Listen, a couple hours ago we lost 
contact with the forward team. I...was 
talking to them over the 
radio when it happened. They were on 
the ground by then, but...They were there 
one second, then nothing the next. 
Do...do you know 
what's going on? Why is 
this happening?"

In the rearview mirror, Maya's 
face was impassionate, 
but it was impossible 
not to feel some concern for herself, 
for her comrades, for the rest of humanity. He 
supposed that he must feel the same way 
too, somewhere. 

((Maybe at last I've found a decent 
way to get this information into the story.))

Erika is...probably a part of the world 
tree. The Heart is too, in a different 
way. 
In the cult, they 
had this myth that the world tree once 
connected all living things, including humans. 
But then somehow, 
a part of it was cut free, 
which is why, even though we're a part 
of this planet's ecosystem, we 
destroy it, cause mass extinctions. Sub
consciously, we're still a part of the 
world tree, but our thoughts and 
emotions aren't part of its whole. 
But that 
branch of the world tree, which represents 
our conscious thoughts still exists---
but somehow it ended up inside 
something with a will of its own, and 
I guess now, Erika's sense of self is 
stronger than ours. And if she goes 
back to the world tree, our consciousnesses 
will go with her."

"How do you know all this?" 
asked Maya. "Auguring stuff?"

"A little bit," said Sebastian. 
"Most 
of it is just guesswork, from the cult 
and from Dr. Alto's notes. But the 

((Maya = Jared, btw))

((Maya = Maria, too))

consequences, this era of silence 
stuff, unless I stop 
her, I know it will happen, even if I 
don't understand why."

"Do you think she does?"

Sebastian swallowed. "I don't know. 
I never thought she would do something like 
this, but I guess I never knew 
her that well, after all."

---

((Then, all the other scenes))

The mist grew thick as he approached 
the world tree, taking on the strange
The boughs of the world tree spread 
before her. Erika stood before the world 
tree, and though it towered above her, 
they seemed titans of equal height. 

"Erika!" he called out to her, but 
she did not hear him. 

On his skin, whispered the prophecies. 
Each step she took towards its trunk 
dug new messages of calamity into his 
flesh. He did not need to look at 
them to know what they said. 

An end for this era, to the end 
of the dominion of thought. All 
hunger will end, all striving, all 
love---all will be washed 
free in the flood...

"Erika, you know what will 
happen if you go! You can't!"

Erika's eyes were dark, glazed by 
thoughts that made her deaf to his words. 
Were they her own? The world tree's? 
Or someone else's entirely. 

The fruit of Yggdrasil returns 
to its parent and from it will 
bloom blood and light...

Erika's gun was in his pocket. 

"Erika, stop!" he said, holding the 
gun in his shaking hands. "I'll stop 
you if I have to."

He saw her eyes flicker towards him, 

[[ there were two ways to free himself: 1. either he care less, and he would be free and she be gone, or 2. he can kill her, and he would be free and she would be dead. ]]


but there was nothing there. She could not 
see him, hear him. She reached out to 
touch the bark of the great tree. 

No... 

Sebastian pulled the trigger. The 
roar was deafening. He 
opened his eyes. 

There was a hole in her head, 
dripping blood with terrible slowness. 
She fell to her knees, then to the ground 
at his feet. 

The stranger who had been Erika had 
disappeared, leaving behind the woman 
who had freed him, saved him, dead 
on the floor, hole in her head, with the 
gun in his hand. 

Sebastian fell to his knees, tears welled 
up in his eyes. 

"Well, this is touching and all, but 
if you're not happy with this outcome, I 
suggest that you change it."

The scene of the world tree faded, 
returning Sebastian to the old 
wasteland and the stone gate. The 
dreamwalker, too, wearing his father's skin. 

"What are you talking about?" Sebastian 
said, drying his eyes and rising to his 
feet. His legs felt weak and 
unstable, and the sense of loss clung 
to him still, even though he knew now 
it was only a dream. 

"The reason I keep coming to your 
dreams it not because I take such a 
keen interest in your daily life, it's 
because they're true."

"But they're not," said Sebastian. 
"I know they're not. They've been wrong 
before."

"If they wrong it's because you made 
them this way. I can't believe you 
haven't noticed this yet."

Sebastian thought back to his 
handful of dreams. He still remembered 
each as vividly as though they had truly 
occurred, even those that 
had not come to pass. 

"There are fixed points in our 
fate---the actions of mortals cannot 
affect them. But you, even though 
you haven't really come into your true 
birthright yet, can 
change these moments, just with your 
own arms and legs. 

"Honestly, it's pretty impressive 
that you've managed to change so much 
so far. But this has been foretold 
since my time, and the world tree is 
not a being that can easily be 
influenced. You might be out of luck this 
time." 

Sebastian walked up to the stone gate, 
and pressed his hand against the sun warmed 
stone. As always, he pushed his shoulder 
against the stone doors, but they did 
not budge. The gap between them had 
not grown at all.

"That's the story of my life, isn't it? 
To know what's coming and to not 
be able to do anything about it. Erika...
I don't want to kill her, but 
there's nothing else I can do..."

"There are never only two options 
for your kind, you know," said the 
dreamwalker. 

"But I'm not a Deva!
I can't rewrite fate. I 
can't do anything. If I could find 
a way to stop Erika without killing 
her, I would, but I can't."

The dreamwalker watched him struggle 
against the gate, 
watching as his knees gave out and 
he sank to the ground, reduced to pounding 
at the door with his fists. 

"Sebastian, come here for a moment."

Sebastian pulled himself up against the 
wall and stumbled over on shaking legs. 
Old cuts on his hands and shoulders 
had split open and were dripping blood 
onto the stone beneath him.

The dreamwalker changed its face 
to Erika's. It caught Sebastian off 
guard, and the beginnings of anger began 
to cloud his face. 

"No, this is important. I need you 
to trust me."

Reluctantly, Sebastian calmed down 
and let the dreamwalker take his 
hands in his own. She walked Sebastian 
to the edge of the outcropping and stood 
on the precipice, above the howling 
winds and wasteland, hundreds of 
feet below. 

"Watch carefully," she said, looking 
down at her feet. 

She raised one foot up and over 
the edge. Carefully, she lowered it, 
shifting her weight backwards 
to follow. Instinctively, Sebastian 
grabbed at her hands, but she did 
not fall. 

She took another step 
backwards and she was standing 
on the air. 

"You are the master here," she 
said. "You can do this and much 
more."

The dreamwalker took another step 
back, tugging at Sebastian's hands to 
do the same. Sebastian's grip tightened 
as he put his foot out over the open air. 
He shut his eyes and tried not to think 
of the dizzying height. 

"No, not like that. You must acknowledge 
the distance, not shut it out."

Sebastian forced his eyes open. Though 
he knew it wasn't here, the 
calm of Erika's expression gave him 
peace. He stepped out over the ledge. 

He was standing now, floating 
over the winds and clouds that surrounded 
the outcropping. 

The dreamwalker smiled. "Nicely done. 
Now come with me."

The dreamwalker led him out into 
the open air. He followed on unsteady 
steps, growing steadier as he saw that 
he wouldn't plunge the ground. 

"If you can overrule the whims 
of gravity, do you not think it's odd that 
you can't even budge 
two stone doors? Let me show you why."

The dreamwalker stepped behind 
the stone gate. 

Hesitantly, Sebastian followed. 

There was nothing behind the door.
Only himself, straining hard to keep the 
door shut, blood streaming down his arms and face. 

"For Vedas, there is nothing that 
can oppose them," the dreamwalker 
said. "only themselves.

"This is not your dream---only one 
like it. But it is still the truth. One 
day you will open that door, but until 
you allow it to open, there will be 
nothing behind there but yourself."

---

Sebastian awoke, feeling the sting of 
fresh cuts across his arms and 
chest. He pushed them from his mind. 
They were not important now, he knew 
what they would say. 

"Sebastian, are you awake?"

Jared called back from the front of 
the van. Outside it was gray dawn. 

"Yeah," he said, letting the remnants 
of his dreams trickle slowly from his 
mind. "I'm awake."

"There are fresh bandages in the 
trunk," he said. "Food and drink too. 
Did you sleep alright?"

"Dreams, again," Sebastian replied, 
reaching over the seat for bandages. 

Jared watched him dress himself 
through the rearview mirror.
"Listen, a couple hours ago, base lost 
contact with the forward command groups. 
They were fine one second, out the next."

"Do they know how far they were 
from the world tree?"

"They estimate about 20 miles out."

"You should probably turn back before 
then."

They fell into silence again, 
watching the landscape fly past them. 
Sebastian was reminded of the quiet days 
he and Erika had passed, barely talking 
to each other at all. But 
tension and uncertainty soured 
the air now.

"Sebastian, do you know what's going 
on over there? The Empath--"

"Erika."

"---Is she the one doing this?"

Sebastian looked outside. 

"It could be. It could be the world tree. 
I wouldn't have thought she would ever 
do something like this, but I 
guess I never knew her that well, 
after all."

"How about the..." Jared made 
a gesture that indicated his hands, arms. 
Sebastian looked down at his 
hastily bandaged arms and fingers. 

"No," he said. "Just more of the 
same. Doom and gloom."

"You're paying a lot of blood for not 
much in return," Jared remarked. 

"I know," Sebastian replied. 

---

The gray of dawn wouldn't seem 
to leave. Sebastian had taken over 
for Jared driving, who was snoring 
now, sprawled out on 
the backseat. The roads were growing 
windy now, snaking along the curves 
of the mountainsides. Old growth forests 
surrounded them on every side. 

Only thirty miles now. Within 
the hour, they would be at Stone 
Temple Forest. 

Sebastian blasted cool air into his 
face. Despite having never been 
here, he felt the air was unseasonably 
warm. Under his bandages he felt 
sweaty and itchy. He felt unsettled, 
unable to rest in his own skin. 

If he was something more than 
mortal, he didn't feel it now. 
If fate were some changeable, 
malleable thing, it seemed so far 
out of reach. 


There was a car on the side of the 
road, stopped. Another convey like 
his. Sebastian was about to pay it no 
mind, but as he passed, he recognized 
the driver's face: a guard from the cult. 
Sebastian pulled the car over to the 
side of the road. 

Jared woke immediately 
with the change of momentum. 
He caught up to Sebastian as he was 
pulling the other car door open. Its 
driver slumped and fell out of the car. 
Sebastian struggled under his weight. 

Jared pulled him off him and laid 
him on the ground. 

"Still alive," said Jared. The man 
was breathing, but his eyes were wide 
open and unresponsive. 

"The back's filled with more like him."

"They're from the cult," Sebastian 
said. "This is my old prison guard."

[[ Sebastian and Jared aren't affected because Erika knows these guys better ]]

"It looks like we won't have 
a problem with the cult."

"Do you know what happened to 
them?"

Sebastian shook his head. "It must 
have been Erika. When you 
touched her, she said it was like 
being erased. It looks
like that's what happened to them."

"And to our guys, up ahead?" 

"Probably." 

"Jesus."

[[ Maybe they think nothing of the containment, send people to chase after her, and then this starts happening. ]]

Jared knelt by the unresponsive 
man, trying to rouse him with 
slaps, water. He would respond, but 
wouldn't break from his stupor. 

"Jared?"

"What, Sebastian?" he said, hauling 
the other[[s]]  from the truck, trying to 
rouse them. 

"You should probably turn back now," 
Sebastian said, staring into the 
prone man's lifeless eyes. "Otherwise 
the same might happen to you." 

"It might happen to you as well."

Sebastian shook his head. "It won't."

"Future vision?" asked Jared. 
Sebastian nodded. 

"I've got orders, you know. To 
keep you under my protection. But 
I won't lie, I'm not willing to 
die for this work. But at the same 
time, if I let you go and you get 
loose and go destroy the world or 
something..."

"I don't think I'm the world 
destroying kind. The [[carseats]], maybe."
said Sebastian with half-hearted humor. 
"And the world is being destroyed 
anyways, isn't it? It hardly matters 
now." 

"Do you really think you can stop her?"

Sebastian shook his head. "No, but 
even it's just to die beside her, I have 
to be there. If I can't do anymore 
than that..."

Jared pulled his gun out of his 
holster. "Here. 
This is yours. They pulled 
it off you when when we took you in. Heaven 
knows why I brought it with me."

It was Erika's gun. Sebastian 
accepted it. 

"Thank you. She left it with me 
with a promise. Doubtless you 
could tell."

"Hey, auguring is your job. I just 
look after you. Make good on that 
promise, kid."

[[ I forgot, Jared was assigned to Sebastian. ]]


"I will. One way or another."

Jared finished pulling the unresponsive 
cultists out of their van and climbed 
into the driver's seat.

"You seem like a good kid. When they 
said I was being assigned to an 
aberration, I never thought it could 
be someone so...normal like you. 
You got dealt 
a bad hand. I wish it had been 
someone else."

"Me too, sometimes. But all 
that will be over soon."

"One way or another. Best of luck 
to you, Sebastian."

"You too, Jared."

Jared turned the van around, drove 
back towards the way they had come. 
Sebastian watched him disappear 
into the distance before getting 
back into their truck and continuing 
onto the Stone Temple forest. 

---

He had passed the cult, vans 
overturned, crashed into trees. He had 
passed the forward convoy, 
sprawled across the roads 
in the middle of setting up a camp, 
now sitting idly, tasks abandoned. 
They had fallen behind, long
ago. Now there was only the 
mountains, the trees. What wildlife, 
if any, were silent. 

The road grew muddy and 
poorly kept. A twist in the road 
combined with a gnarled tree root 
sent the truck careening off 
the side of the road. Sebastian 
pulled food, water, and fresh 
bandages from the truck and 
abandoned it there, walking 
the rest of the way. 

A warm mist twisted among 
the trees, clinging to Sebastian's 
skin and mingling with his sweat. 
It seemed to thicken the air and 
swallow all sounds. There was no 
sign of the sun above him. Often, 
Sebastian wondered if he was lost, 
but there was only one road into 
the heart of the forest, and it led 
to the world tree.

Thirst haunted him, 
then hunger, so he ate and drank. 
He had sweat through his bandages 
and they grew damp and itchy, so 
he changed them. [[ odd that he can walk despite pretty much dying, no? ]] New 
cuts stretched across his thighs 
and chest, murmurs of the new 
age of unified heart and mind. 
Sebastian ignored them. 

It was evening when Sebastian 
reached the end of the road. The 
featureless gray of the sky was 
fading to dusky blue. The forest 
beneath the canopy darkened 
quickly, and Sebastian was 
relieved to reach the cave before 
dark. 

There were two cultists stationed outside 
the cave, but they were inert 
now. They laid on the ground, 
breathing, blinking, but little else. 

Sebastian knelt beside one, 
and pushed his ear to his mouth. 
Small sounds were pushed from 
his throat with each exhale. 

"I am waiting, Augur."

Sebastian stood and faced the 
darkness of the cave. 

"I've come, Empath."

---

The cave was dark, lit only 
by the dying torches the cultists had 
left behind, sputtering more dark smoke 
than light. More cultists, too, had 
been stationed deeper in the cave, 
but they fared no better than their 
companions outside. This near to the 
world tree, and to Erika, their 
mouths moved along to half formed 
vocalizations, relays to her 
thoughts. Sebastian did not take 
the time to decipher them, and 
instead just followed the cave 
downwards, deeper into the earth. 

The same warm mist from 
outside was thick here, mingling 
with the smoke. It took on 
strange figures as it pushed past 
him, leaving him feeling chilled. 
At times he could see no more 
than a foot in front of him. 

A misstep. There was no 
ground where he thought it would 
be. Instead, there was a perilous 
drop. The mist swirled, hundreds 
of meters below his feet. 
Sebastian's breath caught in his 
throat. 

"You must acknowledge the distance, 
not shut it out."

Shaking, Sebastian stepped back 
from the ledge. He found a ladder 
downwards some feet away, and 
climbed down. 

---

The mist grew light as he 
approached the world tree, taking 
---

((Then, all the other scenes))

The mist grew thick as he approached 
the world tree, taking on the strange
violet light emitted by its forests high 
in the cavern above them. It crawled 
swiftly on the ground, despite the still 
air. 

The world tree's glen was 
verdant, despite the lack of sunlight. 
Green grass and herbs lined the 
rich soil, cut through with streams 
of water. At the center, the world tree 
towered, as wide as a hundred 
men, as tall as the depths [[of]] the 
cavern and beyond. 

And Erika was there, at its roots. 

"Sebastian," she said, not with her voice, 
but her mind. Even so, Sebastian felt 
his heart lift to hear her again. 

"Erika," he called out to her. "You 
waited for---ha!"

Sebastian cried out as great gouges 
appeared in the skin of his back. 

Seeds cannot be persuaded from 
springing. She must be stopped.

"Did you come here to kill me?" 
Her voice was mirthful in his mind. 
"You are not the only one. You've seen what's 
become of those who have tried."

Sebastian picked himself off the ground. 

"Not if I can help it," he said. 
His steps faltered as new wounds 
drove themselves into his arms and legs. 
But though the pain was like 
a physical force weighing on his 
limbs, he fought to make his way 
over to the world tree. Erika did not 
move to help him, and instead, stood 
gazing up into the world 
tree. Above them, its branches, 
like ghostly tendrils, reached upwards 
into the darkness. Its fruit, bulbous 
and glistening with unearthly lights, sat 
nestled in the crooks of its limbs, 
seeming too heavy for its thin boughs. 

"You know what will happen, if you 
touch it, don't you, Erika? It won't be 
just you, the whole of humanity will go 
with you," he said. "No more thoughts, 
no more feelings."

"I know," she said. "That's why I 
told you not to come after me. 
You 
would never stand for it."

"But you waited for me," he said. 

She turned to face him  at last. 
Her face was lit by the light of the 
world tree, and her eyes had taken on 
the same violet tint of the fruit. When 
she looked over to him, she seemed 
to be seeing more than himself. But her 
face was the same as always, 
and watched him with affection. 

"I can save you, you know," she said. 
It was 
strange to hear her voice resound so clearly 
in his mind 
without speaking---that she could sound 
so close but seem so far. "From the flood. 
And then it would be just the two of us. 
This whole world would be silent. We 
could go to Rome, to Shanghai. You 
could show me London. And everything 
would be so peaceful and quiet."

Sebastian shook his head. "It wouldn't 
be the same."

Sebastian could see the pain in her eyes. 
"I know that it's wrong, Sebastian. I know 
that I don't have the right to make this 
choice. But all my life, I've been so 
unsure, what is me, what is someone 
else---what do I want, what do others 
want from me? But these past few days, 
I've felt so clear, like a lens that's 
finally come into focus. And I've never 
wanted anything as badly as I want 
this."

"But what if it's not what you want? 
What if," he asked, grasping for the right words. 
"it's just the part of you that's 
like the world tree?"

"There is no other part of me," she 
said. "
This is what's left, when 
all those thoughts and feelings have 
gone away. And if that's nothing 
more than a slave to the world tree, 
then so be it. {I'm tired of trying to 
be something I'm not.}"

"But what about---"Sebastian 
grasped at his memories of her, 
her, confused at the cult, her 
hatred for Freeman. 
At the happiness in 
their brief time in the woods, at 
her strength when he was weak. 
There was something there, 
inexpressible, more than the intruding 
feelings of the strangers and the impulses 
of the tree of leaves. 

Erika smiled sadly. "When I was 
with you, I was the person you wanted 
me to be, Sebastian. I liked [[italicized]] being 
the person I was when I was with you, but it still 
wasn't me."

"Why isn't that enough?" Sebastian 
pleaded. "Why 
isn't it enough just to go home, 
back to the way things were?"

[[ You know why it's not enough. It's the same reason you've never turned back, even though it's killing you to be here now. ]]

"You know why as much as I do," she 
said. "And besides, at some point, we can't 
turn back any longer."

"I---I don't want you to go," 
he said. "And I can't stand by 
and let you leave."

"I know," she said. "Do you still 
have my gun, Sebastian?"

He nodded and pulled it from under 
his shirt. 

There was a moment of heavy silence 
between them as Erika reached 
out for the gun. But, as she tugged, it 
came away from his hand with 
no resistance. For a moment, she seemed 
unsure what to do with it, but instinct 
took over. She unloaded the magazine, 
checked that it was full, before loading 
it again and racking the slide. She 
handed it back. 

"I have to go," she said, voice 
quiet. "I have to know what it's like, 
what it means." 

Sebastian looked down to the gun in 
his his hands. "I can't stop you, can I?" 
He unloaded it, and set it on the ground. "Will 
you let me come with you?" He 
extended a hand. 

To his surprise, she pulled off her gloves 
and took his hand in hers. Sebastian 
had just barely felt its warmth before 
his mind was encompassed in the 
flood of hers. 

The fruit, the mist, the tree were 
singing. It was achingly beautiful, 
a spectrum of perfect sound. It 
made his--no, Erika's throat yearn 
desperately to join them in song. Her 
thoughts were fluid, rushing and 
entwining themselves into a great 
stream. HIs awareness among them 
was only a small boat acrest a 
giant wave, kept afloat only by her 
restraint. The mist on her skin, the 
dull ache of the wound on her chest, 
her love and doubt, 
were all around him. And then 
the world tree, like a weight on her 
mind, around which all thought circled. 

Both he and Erika doubled over in 
shared pain as fire seemed to bisect 
his spine. New words carved themselves 
furiously on his back, one half spelling 
the doom he had condemned humanity to, 
the other 
how the knowledge of saving 
humanity would sooth the life long heartache 
of his betrayal. Erika's 
thoughts faltered as Sebastian's body stumbled 
at the sudden onset of pain. But the singing 
grew louder, more insisted. His pain would 
be over soon, if she could only touch the 
world tree. 

Erika helped Sebastian to his feet. He 
looked at himself through her eyes. His 
shoulders, his hands, feet, were riddled 
with scars. His face looked so pale 
and bloodless as blood streamed down his back. 
New cuts, like spider webs, began to 
creep up his neck to his face. He seemed 
to be disintegrating before her eyes. 

"I will be okay," he said, mind to mind. 

She lowered his body gently against the 
trunk of the world tree, then kneeled down 
beside him herself. He looked into her eyes. 

"Goodbye," he said. "For now."

"Goodbye," she replied. Her voice was 
hoarse, but warm.

And still holding his hand, she pressed
her head into the back of the world tree, 
and was gone. 

---

((The End. Haha. ))

Sebastian felt her go, and was 
left limp and alone. Tears 
fell from his eyes. Never before had he felt so 
painfully alone. 

The mist grew thick. The branches of 
the world tree shivered, as if blown by 
a gale. Agony rippled across his skin 
as new prophecies of the new era of 
mankind overwrote the old. He had 
not stopped her. It would begin soon. 

[[ he might want her to die; he realizes that this is Erika + fate pushing him to feel this way ]]

He saw now that it was his own tangle 
of choices that had brought him here to 
this day. He had fought so hard to escape 
the fate that had been prescribed to him, 
though each step had only 
ever taken him closer to it. 
But in the end, 
he had still won. It was 
proof that despite the burden of fate, his 
choices were still his own. 

[[ He has another self, after the moment of transformation, that wants him to let Erika die, to kill her, to save himself. They disagree---is it even a meaningful disagreement? Are they really even the same people? Does he meaningfully move through time any more? ]]

[[ It's just a reflection of the reality of the dual truth; He at once regrets his choice and believes it was right, but his regrets are sent to the past, his hopes to the future ]]

The victory was hollow though. He hadn't 
killed her, but she was still gone 
forever from his reach. 
What was the point, 
then, of freeing himself 
if Erika could not?

The wiry scrawl of lacerations crept 
up to his hands and feet. Pain seemed less 
a feeling than a separate entity, 
thrashing within his skin. 
He could feel his consciousness slipping 
as the wounds began to deepen. With a 
shudder, he let them overtake him---they 
were not important now. 

There was something left of her, beyond 
the role fate had assigned her. 
It was not too late to find it. 
The creeping spread of the prophecies 
stopped, as if frozen. But only for a 
moment, before they suddenly exploded 
outwards, fractally outwards to lace his 
entire body. Sebastian opened his 
eyes [[to see one last time before going blind ]] and directed his fading vision 
up and outward. He saw both the branches of the 
world tree and the mists of 
the stone gate. 

"I'm coming for you, Erika." 

Sebastian reached out to touch the gate. 
Just the barest brush against the wall of mists 
sent a shock of pain through his. His 
wounds began to glow with golden light. They 
burned brighter as they wound tight around him, 
like a net of light. Sebastian let the 
wounds wind deeper into him, burning hotter 
and hotter, until there was nothing left but light. 

Ash fell to the floor of the clearing, [[and was]] 
lost to the mist. And Sebastian was gone too. 

---

At the stone gate, the 
door had long since opened. From them 
poured a torrent of mists, 
tearing at his skin as Sebastian fought 
to push through them. Each step that 
brought him closer drove blades 
of cold and chill into his body, anathema 
to his very being. But it would not stop him. 
Sebastian persevered through it---he would 
not [[ be ]] swayed. 

As he drove through first hand, then 
shoulder, then head, then chest, he felt the 
mist pull and tug. They ate at skin, 
then flesh, and then when flesh was no 
more, turned to mind and memory. They 
wound around the faded memories of his 
youth, his fears and aspirations, at his 
very sense of self. 

[[ he is folded into the fabric of the things that must be; he can change that which he represents, but only if he joins the whole ]]

Not yet, he thought, there's just one more thing 
I have to do.

And he bundled away the very core of himself 
and let the mists pull away the rest. 

He was on the other side of the gate now, 
alone on the precipice above a rolling sea of clouds. 
Those muddled and twisting 
paths he had walked his entire life were 
laid out before him now. 

He rose up into the sky. 

The world of the Devas was inscribed 
in fate---clear and concrete where it is 
decided, muddled and fogged where it is not. 
In the churn of mists and clarity below, 
Sebastian found the moment that he had 
just left.

The glen of the world tree was resplendent 
in a way that Sebastian had not seen 
before. Its branches and fruit glittered 
with a shining clarity that Sebastian 
perceived now with the whole of his being. 
With new eyes so 
unlike his own, he saw no how its branches 
reached beyond the physical, stretching and splitting until it 
touched into every cell of every living thing. 
And Erika was there now, entwined with 
the fibers of its branches, its 
roots, in the 
minds of humankind across the globe. 

"Erika," he called out to her. "Can you 
hear me?"

The voice in reply was the smallest of 
whispers, spoken by every mind at once. 

"Sebastian, it's beginning, the 
tying of minds. But I cannot find you? Are you 
safe?"

"I am here, at the world tree."

Erika's awareness, like a flash of lightning, 
returned to the world tree. Sebastian settled 
in the crown of its boughs. 

"What is it like, Erika?"

Sebastian looked up. At once he saw the 
darkness of the cavern, at once the 
fractal infinity of the world tree's branches, 
at once clouds above the stone gate. 
They rushed by at an exaggerate pace as the 
moment slowed. 

"I see from a billion eyes," she said. 
"My heart beats in a billion chests. I 
feel the thoughts of a thousand million 
as I hear my own. I touch every corner of 
[[the]] earth, my roots its hearts, my branches 
the synapses of every creature that walks, 
that has walked, will ever walk this earth."

"Can I see?"

The tree around him rustled. The bark 
parted before him, revealing the tree's 
white flesh, running with rivulets of purple 
light. Sebastian reached out to touch it. 

Music filled his ears, ethereal and sublime. 
Notes of discord were joining them now, being 
tied in and spooled to new and strange 
harmonies. In them, he recognized 
Erika's voice, and let the music take in his 
own.

Sebastian felt the bounds of his consciousness 
spread, faster than he could expand to fill it. 
In the gaps flooded the chorus of a million 
voices, hundreds of thousands of disjointed 
thoughts and dreams. As he struggled to center 
himself, the kaleidoscope of colors and 
sounds arranged themselves into 
branches, leaves, nodules, and fruits, and 
he found himself running alongside a swift 
moving stream of thought and feeling, 
entangled inextricably with Erika. 

In the world around them, the 
world fell to pieces. Cars crashed, 
patients died in hospital beds, planes 
fell from the skies. A great chorus of 
disaster was seizing the world. Soon it 
would fall still and silent. [[ What little was left from the ashes would arise again, but different before. Colorless. Sterile. ]]

"Do you regret it, Erika? Is it what 
you thought it would be?"

She answered him without words. He was 
given a sense of profound peace, the final 
freedom from a life long chase for the unattainable. 
The slowly fading sense of self [[that]] was never 
more than an illusion from the start. The 
tree had no mind, no individuality, no 
desires of its own. Erika, in her heart, 
knew she was the same, and was finally 
free of the desire to be anything more than 
that. 

"Was it really so bad, Erika? Being 
alive? Being with me?"

From him was pulled his memories of her, of his attempts to flee from the cult, of her confusing companionship as a prisoner of the cult, of her deadly proficiency in the labyrinth at the Gallery, of watching the rain fall in sheets over the [[not sure what this word is ]] surface of the lake. He received [[in return]] years and years of confusion and pain---first smothered under her own mother's mind, then caged like an animal in the foundation, then struggling until finally submitting to the cult's will. Their winter together was like a light in a life otherwise filled with darkness. She thought she could bare it again, if it could mean his freedom, but no longer, it seemed, could she pretend that all the terrible things in life were happening to someone else. But now that she was gone, back into the embrace of the world tree, there was no one left to suffer through them. 


"But it was worth it, wasn't it? Living, 
in spite of the burdens we bare?"

But there was no response. The thoughts 
of the world tree and its many captive 
minds rushed voicelessly around him. 

Distraught, Sebastian cried out. In the 
far distance, the world was crumbling. 
Machines churning under the hands of 
their absent owners, infants crying 
on their mother's arms, human life 
falling still and silent. Scattered 
through the world tree, he felt them 
slip away from him, like water 
through his fingers. 

All throughout his life, he had let so much 
fall from his reach. But if there was only 
one thing he could hold on to...

Sebastian reached deep into the 
world tree, absorbed its streams of 
thought and life. It railed against 
this inquest of individuality, of defiance 
of [[its]] cohesive whole, but 
there was nothing it could do. Sebastian 
had left his humanity far behind. 
In the world tree's fold of consciousnesses, 
he searched for anything he could find 
of Erika. Moments, thoughts, feelings, 
he held them close in his heart, 
insulated from his own internal fire.

The world tree fought him for it, 
tugged back at them, tried to beguile 
him with song. But he ignored it and 
reached up with golden fire, to the 
tips of the boughs and plucked free the 
bits [[pieces]] of Erika's self. 

The world tree constricted around 
him. Instinctively, he lashed out to free 
himself with fire. It let him go, but 
he could not control the flames, and 
they roared through him, consuming more 
of himself as he fought to seize hold 
of it. 

Sebastian retreated from the tree. He 
drifted down to its trunks [[localizing, temporally anchoring himself becomes harder]]where Erika's 
body still kneeled against it. He let 
what he had gathered flow from him back 
into her body. 

He felt her eyelids flicker beneath their 
lids. 

There was still more of her, dispersed far 
and wide through the world tree, across the 
world. But the task did not daunt him---
he would bring it back. 

---

Erika opened her eyes. The boughs 
of the world tree were above her. It 
was a sight she thought she would 
never see again. 

She started 
up. Where was Sebastian? Her thoughts were 
in disarray---he had come to 
find her, they had spoken---she turned 
to her side, where 
she had left him, but there was no one there. 
Only scraps of bandages, fading to ash. 

"Sebastian?" she called out into the cavern. 
But there was only silence in response. 

Silence. No singing from the world 
tree. No voices from nearby minds. [[ No stray thoughts, no intruding feelings. ]]
Never before had she heard such 
pure and absolute silence. 

"Sebastian?" she whispered, [[afraid]].

"I am here," said a voice, quiet.

Erika spun around, unaccustomed to 
being startled. 

"Sebastian, I---"

It wasn't him. Instead, there was a 
silhouette of golden script [[hunched over, as if fighting not to be crushed flat into the ground]], words swimming 
on its surface like oil on water. 
Its glow was indistinct, like a shadow 
of light. Erika looked carefully across its 
featureless face. 

"Sebastian, is that you?" 

"It is," he said. His voice was distant, 
as though he were speaking from somewhere 
far away. But, unmistakably, it was his. 

"What...what happened? I was in the 
world tree---I thought I heard your voice."

"You became part of the world tree," he 
said. "But I 
pulled you back out, and each piece I 
took, I cut free from 
fate, from the world tree. You are free now."

"Is that what this silence is?" her own 
voice sounded unbearably loud in her ears. "It's 
so quiet now."

The silhouette nodded. 


"But what about you, Sebastian? Why are 
you like this?" She 
reached out to touch him, but the silhouette 
shied away. "What happened to you?"

"This is me," he said. "My body is gone. 
It was the price I paid to sever you 
from the world tree." [[ My power for yours. Your freedom for mine. Inextricably linked, inescapably tied. ]] 

Erika stepped back. "No, no you 
didn't need to do that. Not to yourself, 
not for me---"

"There was no other way," 
he said. "What I suspected before, I 
know now. In all the many winding 
paths of fate, there were none that 
if two of us enter, two can leave."

"It should have you been you," she said. "Not 
me---I don't deserve it. I'm not---"

"It's what I wanted," he said. "
I had twenty 
years to live my life, Erika. Another 
five I stole for myself. Now that it's gone, 
I see how precious it was. I wanted you 
to have the same."

Erika shook her head. "What's the point, 
Sebastian, without you? That's all I wanted."

"Me, too, Erika." There was a change 
in that whispered voice. The 
careful distance broke, there was a pain 
in it that now removed any doubt 
that it truly was him. "I thought I 
could save you and still be myself, 
but the world tree, it fought so hard for you. 
I was stronger, but 
I had to give myself to the divine, there's 
barely anything left. Just to be here, even this 
place, it's so thick with clouds---I can 
barely hear you, I can barely see you. I 
can't touch you."

The gold lined silhouette folded its 
face into its hands. Its shoulders shook 
with tearless, silent sobs. 

Erika reached out again, unsure about 
the language of touch. She found what 
once had been his face and let her fingers 
trace the lines of script that had once 
covered his body as scars. 

"It doesn't matter, does it? It's the same 
as always. We can run 
away, find some place where these things 
don't matter. We'll figure it out."

Sebastian shook his head. "I can't. Not this 
time. The world tree still has part 
of you, it's still pulling at the rest of 
you. If I let it free, it will 
bring you back, and the rest of humankind too. 
I'm a part of it now, Erika. A skin 
over its synapses that keeps it sealed 
away from the fates of humankind."

"I don't understand," 
she said. Her eyes began to 
sting. "Why if not me, then you? Why 
did it take you too? Why can't we 
just be free of it?"

"It was my choices that brought me here. 
There are some things even the divine 
cannot change. I could save you, but then 
I had to take your place. Our 
fates are entwined, Erika, but they 
are entwined to be apart."

[[ Sebastian had to make the same choice, his freedom at the cost of Erika's, just chronologically in reverse, which is the same to him. And all this time he was living with a shadow of her, which he could see in the future. ]]

Sebastian's silhouette flickered dimly 
now. At times the lines of gold grew 
so faint as to disappear entirely, leaving 
only a shimmer of clarity in the fogged air. 

"It's so quiet now," she said. "The world 
seems so vast and empty now."

"It is vast," he said. "But soon you'll 
find things to fill it with. I remember 
how it used to seem to me. Unending, 
always something new on the horizon. 
That's what it will be to you now."

"I don't want it," she said. "Not 
if it means leaving you like this, here, alone."

"I won't be alone," he said, looking 
upwards. "I am the world tree now, 
in the soul of every living thing, every 
neuron of the human mind, every 
thought voiced and unvoiced. Yours included. This is your 
gift to me, and freedom is 
mine to you. Use it well."

"It's a heavy burden to bear," she said, 
smiling sadly. 

"You'll bear it well. I can see it already," he said. "Be 
well, Erika."

"Thank you, Sebastian. 
For everything. Without you, I---I don't 
even know what I would be without you. 
And now we have to say goodbye."

"Only in some ways," he said. "In 
others we will never be apart. Goodbye, 
Erika."

"Goodbye, Sebastian."

---


"Goodbye, Sebastian."

"Goodbye, Erika."

She began the long trek out of 
the Temple Cave. As she climbed 
from the dark, the cultists were 
beginning to come out of the stupors. 
Some of them made to stop her, but 
stopped in their tracks, doubtless 
under the influence of the world 
tree. 

At last, she reached outside. The 
fever mist had broken and the night 
was cool and clear. The stars sparkled 
above her, the light so similar yet 
so different from the light of the 
world tree. 

A sudden weakness brought her to 
her knees. Unbidden, tears began 
to flow from her eyes, and with them 
they brought body wracking sobs. 
She had gone to the world tree fully 
intending to die. Now there was the 
whole world waiting for her, 
and Sebastian would not be there. 

But she felt a 
calm she had never felt before, 
Her thoughts were clear and crystalline 
in their sharpness, and she could push them 
from her mind and enjoy the quiet sounds 
of the forest and the night that she could 
so rarely enjoy before. This moment of 
calm, this moment of grief was indisputably 
her own. 

There was a sound of a car's 
engine a long ways off, but coming 
closer. Erika set off along the road 
to meet it. 

Down the road, the car's 
engine idled. Its headlights cut a 
sharp swath of white light against 
the night. The car's owner stood 
at the side of the road, scratching 
his head in the reflected light. 

[[ What about the other Foundation folks? I suppose Sebastian arranges so that they don't get in the way. ]]

Erika recognized him. 

"Jared?"

He seemed startled to see her. She 
saw his hands flinch towards his 
holster. She put her hands up 
to assure him. 

"Who are you? How do you know 
who I am?"

"You were a friend of Sebastian's. 
I was, as well."
"His friend? You don't mean---the Empath?" 
Jared made for his gun again. 

Erika shook her head. "Not anymore. 
It's all over now."

[[ Jared didn't seem to believe her. "Do you think you'd be alive still, if it wasn't?" ]]

"I suppose you're right. Up ahead 
people are coming back to, if the 
radio is to be believed." Jared 
relaxed again. "There were a couple 
of dicey moments back then. I blanked 
out for a moment back there. 
One second I was driving 
along, the next crashed against the 
tree. I thought that was the end 
of everything."

"Nope. Everything is under control now."

"Thanks to you?" 


"No. Not me. Sebastian," Erika said. 
"This other car looks like it's in 
better shape than yours."

"Yeah, it's the one I leant to 
Sebastian. I was going to see if I 
could get it out of the mud."

"Do you need a hand?"

Jared revved the car 
while Erika pushed from the front. 
A moment later it was free. Jared 
backed it onto the road. 

"You need a ride?" he said, pushing 
open the door. 

[[perplexed at his own kindness]]

"If you don't mind," she said. 

"You don't happen to know where 
he is, Sebastian? Technically I've 
got to bring him back to the Foundation," 
he asked once she was seated. 

Erika shook his head. "He's gone 
now. Dead."

"Oh."

Jared stopped the car. He stared 
blankly at the empty road. After 
a moment, he started driving again. 

"Sorry for not believing you, but 
you two don't have the best track record 
for resisting containment. I---"

[[ he also wants to take Erika back to the Foundation ]]
Jason slammed his foot down on the 
brakes, sat stunned in his seat. 
In his eyes, Erika thought she caught 
a glimpse of a flash of gold. 

He looked over to Erika, as if he 
had seen a ghost. 

"No," he said, distantly. "
Nevermind. I believe you."

Jason pulled the car around. 

"It's a pity. He was a good kid. He 
didn't deserve it."

"Yeah," Erika agreed, tightening her 
grip on the seat belt. 

"Where are you headed? I can 
give you a ride, if it's not too far 
away."

"It's not far. Just over the mountains 
from here. You head---"

"Yeah. I know the place. It's in 
your case notes," he 
explained. "I wouldn't stay too long, 
if you want to avoid the Foundation."

"Yeah, I know. I just 
need to take care of a few things."

[[ she's taking back the papers she stole from the cult. ]]

"I understand," he said, and 
started on the long drive through the 
night. 

"Do you want me to put on some 
radio or something?" Jason asked. 

"No. The silence is fine."

---

Erika was dreaming true dreams.

It had taken some time to get used 
to, after the wild mosaics of the 
dreamers around her. She used to wake 
up, disoriented, unsure whether she 
had woken from from dream or vision. 

These days though, she could tell 
without difficulty. She was 
dreaming now. 

She was in their old cabin in the 
woods. In her dreams, she could still 
hear the distant voices of 
stranger's minds, though the memories 
were fast fading from her waking 
mind. The townspeople dreamt in 
the distance, fought, made love. 
Nearer by, Jared pondered the flash 
of connection that had 
wiped him from his own mind, 
and when it restored him, left him with 
memories of Sebastian's final 
moments. 

She would be alone in her dreams 
tonight, it seemed. 
Though sometimes she had dreams of him, 
it was never truly Sebastian. But even 
the hazy simulacra constructed from 
her memories gave her peace, let 
her relieve the brief time they had 
had together. 

Though Sebastian 
was gone, there were signs of him 
scattered about the cabin. 
The unkempt 
blankets around his spot 
by the fire, books in left 
in tents that he had never finished, 
hand prints in the dust. 
Erika remembered 
how she had wept to see it all again, 
all those years ago. 
The feelings had barely faded since then. 

[[a sadness sharp and unshakable ]]

Erika wondered where he was. 
Still warring with the world tree? 
Maybe skating the surfaces of minds 
across the world, maybe singing along to 
the world tree's unending song? 

"Would you like to see?"

The voice cut through the softness 
of Erika's dream. Erika spun around 
to face its source. She was no longer 
in the cabin. She was standing 
on a stone outcropping above a sea 
of clouds. Before a stone gate, someone was wearing 
Sebastian's skin. 

"Can never fool an Empath," said 
the dreamwalker. "Even a former one. 
Calm yourself. I only chose this 
face since there were no other 
ones I could borrow."

Erika relented. "The dreamwalker, 
aren't you? What do you want with me?"

"Just thought I would track down 
the last vestiges of that fiasco with 
the world tree. It faded very quickly 
from the conscious minds. He did 
a very thorough job of cutting it off, 
Sebastian. Of the entire world of dreamers, 
only you still think of it."

"He's still there, then? Holding back 
the world tree?" 

[[ gotta fix the way she speaks here too. ]]

"Yes. A bit of an Atlassian task, 
even for a Deva. But he's taken 
to it easily. You can see it, over 
there."


Erika followed his gaze 
beyond the stone 
gate, out over the sea of clouds. 
She made to move closer to get a 
better look, but some invisible force 
prevented her from crossing the 
threshold of the gate. 

"Only the Deva can pass through 
there," said the dreamwalker. "
Once crossed, you 
cannot cross back."

"Where is the world tree?" Erika 
asked, resting a hand on the stone. 
It was strangely warm. Erika was 
reminded of the flicker of flames 
across Sebastian's skin. 

"That patch of clouds, there," 
he said, pointing to a great mountain 
of billowing cumulus. "Before all 
this you could actually see the world 
tree from here.

"Devas are creatures of fate. 
They guard it, change it. They 
congregate where it is strongest, 
at the decisive moments of our 
times. Everywhere else is indistinct
to them---clouded and lost in the fog."

"Then, Sebastian---"

"He's defying his own nature to 
protect you. I can't imagine what it's 
like."

"I can," Erika said. "Sebastian, too, 
he knew as well."

"At this point he's not really a 
Deva anymore. There isn't really a 
word for what he is."

"That sounds like Sebastian, to 
me," she said, smiling to herself.

"What about you? Usually those 
touched by the Deva go on to 
lead lives of greatness, but to give 
his life and to get nothing but a small town hunter---"

Erika spun around, catching 
the dreamwalker by the collar of 
his shirt. She threw him the 
ground and shoved her knee into his 
chest. She reached for her hip 
and was pleased to find her pistol 
in its holster. 

"I don't suppose you'll die if 
I kill you," she said, 
cocking the gun in his face. 
pulling back the safety. 

"No," he croaked, lungs emptied 
of air. 

"Good, then I'll feel much better about 
this when I wake up---"

"Wait! I didn't mean anything 
by that. I just meant to tell you: 
it would have killed him, one 
day. The transformation. 
He had to give into it, 
or he would have died resisting it. 
It's good that something came of 
it, even if it's just a small 
town hunter."

Reluctantly, Erika stood up, 
letting the dreamwalker rise to 
his feet. She offered him a hand. 

"I'm not much of a hunter these 
days, anyways. I lost the stomach 
for it. I switched to 
photography mostly, though it doesn't 
pay the bills nearly as well."

"Paying the bills, you say? 
I suppose that's fitting of the one 
touched by the anti-Deva." The 
dreamwalker took her hand. Though 
it was stiff and unyielding he 
appreciated the gesture. 
"It's what most of us do," she said. 
"The great song of the world 
tree, most of its voices are just people 
trying to get by day by day. I used to have 
such disgust for them, but now that 
I'm living it, it doesn't seem so bad."

"It's a much better way to join 
the world tree," the dreamwalker 
agreed. 

"It's a pity Sebastian 
couldn't," Erika said quietly. 

"No Deva ever has," the 
dreamwalker said. Then, after a moment of contemplation. "You know, Sebastian's 
story isn't over yet. He's something 
new in the world---he won't be left 
alone. And you and he have entwined 
your fates, so yours isn't either."

Erika looked over at him suspiciously. 

"I don't intend to answer any calls. 
Sebastian fought hard to free from 
such things. If you show up here 
trying to rope me into any causes, I will kill you."

"Your point is well taken, Empath. 
Or should I say, nobody 
and nothing."

"Nobody and nothing was who I used 
to be. I am myself now. That's all I 
need."

The dreamwalker bowed his head 
in deference, and stepped backwards 
out of the dream.

Erika could feel herself pulling from 
the dream as well. She looked 
out to the great promontory of 
clouds. It seemed unreachably far 
away, though she knew the world 
tree [[was never]] more than a few days journey 
in the waking world. Some days 
it took all of her will power to 
not throw everything away 
and go to it, to its unearthly song 
and to Sebastian. But other days it 
barely crossed her mind. Slowly but surely, 
the stretches were the world tree barely interfered 
in her thoughts, and it was this she remembered in 
moments of weakness, and the pure contentment of the days she 
had spent with Sebastian. One day, if 
she lived long enough, she would find it again. 
She would have faith in Sebastian's choice.
